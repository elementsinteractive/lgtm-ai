**Summary:**

This PR makes minor updates to configuration files: updating the cruft template commit and adding 'pre-commit' and 'pre-push' hooks to the pre-commit config. There are no changes to code, and the modifications should improve development workflow with better pre-commit hook coverage. There are no issues related to correctness, testing, or security. The only suggestion relates to a minor indentation inconsistency for readability in the YAML file. Overall, the PR is well-prepared and ready to merge after (optional) minor formatting touch-ups.

**Specific Comments:**

- ü¶â **[Quality]** üîµ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:34`




```yaml
      - "commit"
      - "pre-commit"
```


For better readability, consider adjusting the indentation of the following lines to match the rest of the file:

```yaml
- "commit"
- "pre-commit"
```
Uniform indentation improves clarity, even if the current YAML is technically correct.

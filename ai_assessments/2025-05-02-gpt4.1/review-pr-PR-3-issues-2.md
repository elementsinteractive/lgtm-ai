**Summary:**

This PR introduces recurring and manual image data-loading via Celery and Django management commands, with test coverage for the command execution. The overall architectural approach and integration with Django and Celery are sound. However, there are some significant correctness issues: unhandled None values, possible KeyErrors from CSV field access, and lack of error handling or logging in key task functions. The settings file has a minor issue due to duplicate DATABASES assignments. Testing coverage is present for command invocation but lacks thoroughness for error/failure conditions or for verifying actual DB changes. Addressing these correctness and testing gaps is necessary before merge, but the overall direction is solid.

**Specific Comments:**

```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
```


If the content argument is None, passing it to csv.DictReader will lead to an exception. Please add an early return if content is None, both in the csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record function and prior to calling it in load_images(). Also, check that the SRC_FILE environment variable is set before using it. Example:

```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str] | None) -> bool:
    if content is None:
        return False
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        ...
```
And in load_images:
```python
src_file = os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")
if not src_file:
    # handle missing SRC_FILE appropriately (log, raise, etc)
    return
content = get_content(src_file)
if not content:
    # handle invalid content
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    ...
```

```python
(image := entry["image"]),
```


Accessing entry["image"] will raise a KeyError if the 'image' column is missing from a CSV row. Use entry.get("image") to safely retrieve the value and avoid an unhandled exception.

Suggested change:
```python
(image := entry.get("image")),
```

```python
Image.objects.all().delete()
parse_csv(content)
```


Since this is an automated Celery task that can interact with external resources or unstable data, add exception handling/logging around the deletion and parsing logic. This will ensure that unexpected issues (such as database or parsing errors) are logged and can be retried or debugged easily. Consider using Celery's retry mechanism if appropriate.

Example addition:
```python
from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger
logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@shared_task(bind=True)
def load_images(self):
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as exc:
        logger.exception("Failed to load images")
        raise self.retry(exc=exc)
```

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:44`




```python
@shared_task
def load_images() -> None:
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
```


There are currently no tests for error or edge cases, nor to verify that image data is actually modified as expected. Please add:
- Tests for the case where SRC_FILE is missing/invalid.
- Tests for malformed/invalid CSV content.
- Asserts on database state before and after calling the management command or Celery task.
These tests will improve robustness and catch regressions.

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": env.dj_db_url(
        "DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60)
    )
}
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


There are two assignments to DATABASES, which is redundant and could lead to confusion. Please remove the duplicate so only a single assignment exists, e.g.:

```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```

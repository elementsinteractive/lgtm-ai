**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Celery scheduled task, a Django management command, and accompanying tests to support periodic (and manual) loading of images from a CSV file at a remote URL. The code is generally well-organized, but requires a few key improvements before being production-ready:

- The main task does not handle the case where the download or validation of the CSV fails (i.e., if the content is None). This could result in runtime errors. Add appropriate checks before processing.
- Accessing CSV fields, particularly 'image', should use .get() and not direct indexing to avoid possible KeyErrors.
- The management command test verifies output, but ideally, should also confirm the underlying task is invoked (using a mock or patch).
- Some redundant assignments and logic (such as 'url = url' and unnecessary nested checks) can be removed for clarity and maintainability.

Once these issues are addressed, the codebase will be more robust and maintainable. The overall structure and solution are solid, but these corrections are necessary before merging.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


If get_content(url) returns None (for example, if the URL is missing, invalid, or unreachable), passing None to 'csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record' or to 'parse_csv' will cause exceptions. You should first check that content is not None before processing:

```python
def load_images() -> None:
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
```

```python
(image := entry["image"]),
```


Using 'entry["image"]' without KeyError handling can cause crashes if a CSV record is missing the 'image' field. Use 'entry.get("image")' for consistency and safety:

```python
for entry in reader:
    if any((entry.get("title"), entry.get("description"), entry.get("image"))):
        return True
```

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8`




```python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "images.management.commands.load_images.load_images",
        lambda *args, **kwargs: None,
    )
    out = StringIO()

    call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

    assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


The test only verifies the command's output, but does not confirm that 'load_images' was actually called. Consider using unittest.mock.patch to confirm invocation:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
...
with patch("images.management.commands.load_images.load_images") as mock_task:
    call_command("load_images", stdout=out)
    assert mock_task.called
```

```python
url = url
```


The assignment 'url = url' is redundant. Please remove this line for clarity.

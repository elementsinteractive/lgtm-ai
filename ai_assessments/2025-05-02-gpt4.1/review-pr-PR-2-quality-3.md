**Summary:**

This PR introduces a well-structured approach to review formatting by introducing formatter abstractions, implementing Markdown and terminal-specific formatters, and updating the GitLab client and scripts to use these abstractions. Comprehensive tests for the Markdown formatter are included, and usage throughout the affected codebase is consistent and well-implemented. No issues affecting correctness, quality, testing, or security were found. The code organization and abstraction are of high quality throughout.

Minor optional improvements could include adding or enriching docstrings in newly introduced classes (notably the `TerminalFormatter` and `MarkDownFormatter`) to help with long-term maintainability and ease future contributions. However, this is a very minor (LOW) quality improvement.

No required changes are necessary. The PR is ready to merge.

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Django management command for loading images and a Celery task for parsing image CSVs via URL, along with a test for the command's execution. The PR has a solid structure but requires attention in several areas:

- Error handling in the main task function is insufficient; there are critical paths where None from helpers is not handled, leading to possible runtime exceptions.
- The CSV processing function can cause a KeyError if input rows are malformed.
- HTTP requests in the helper function need more robust exception and error management to handle failures gracefully.
- There is a redundant DATABASES assignment in the settings, which should be cleaned up.
- The management command uses an improper return style instead of Django's output conventions.
- Test coverage is basic and does not exercise error paths or verify core side-effects.

Overall, the direction is good, but key areas for improvement remain: especially input robustness, error handling, quality/maintainability, and thorough testing. Addressing these will make the PR production ready.

**Specific Comments:**

```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


The function get_content can return None (if the URL is missing or invalid). This None result is passed directly to csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record, which then passes it to csv.DictReader, leading to a TypeError. You must check if content is not None before further processing.

Suggestion:
```python
content = get_content(...)
if content is None:
    # Handle error (e.g., log, raise exception, skip)
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    ...
```

```python
(image := entry["image"]),
```


csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record assumes that every row has an "image" key. If the CSV is malformed and a row is missing this key, this will raise a KeyError. Use .get() instead or add explicit error handling.

Suggestion:
```python
(image := entry.get("image")),
```

```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


If the request to get_content fails (non-200 status, timeout, network, etc.), you don't handle exceptions or error cases. httpx.get() may raise exceptions (e.g., httpx.ConnectTimeout), and response may not be 200. Consider adding robust exception handling and logging to prevent crashes and to surface debugging information.

Suggestion:
```python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text.splitlines(True)
    # else handle unexpected status
except httpx.HTTPError as e:
    # handle/log the error
    return None
```

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": env.dj_db_url(
        "DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60)
    )
}
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


There is now a duplicate DATABASES declaration. Please remove the older, multi-line block to avoid confusion and accidental misconfiguration.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:14`




```python
def handle(self, *args, **options):
    load_images()
    return "Done"
```


Django management commands should print output via self.stdout.write or use self.style.SUCCESS, not return a string from handle(). Returning from handle() is non-standard and has no effect.

Suggestion:
```python
self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Done"))
```

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댯 `tests/images/test_commands.py:17`




```python
assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


The current test only checks that the management command can be called and writes 'Done', because the core load_images logic is monkeypatched as a no-op. Consider adding tests that:
- Check side effects (e.g., actual image loading, deletion, CSV parsing) by mocking dependencies at a lower level.
- Exercise error scenarios (missing/invalid CSV, unset environment variable, etc.).
Doing so will increase confidence in reliability and correctness.

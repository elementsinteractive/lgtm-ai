游불 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 游녨

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a flexible and extensible formatting subsystem for LGTM review output, with clear separation of concerns and robust type safety. Markdown and terminal formatters are now implemented via a protocol/interface-based approach. The refactor is thorough, and tests cover the new formatters and their integration. There are no correctness, testing, or security issues. The only point for improvement is minor: leftover references and comments to old formatting properties ('formatted_severity' and 'formatted_score') in the models (src/lgtm/ai/schemas.py) should be removed now that all formatting concerns are managed by the new formatter system. This is a low-severity maintainability issue. Overall, the PR is of high quality and ready to merge after optional cleanup.

```python
    @property
    def formatted_severity(self) -> str:
        emoji = {
            "LOW": "游릭",
            "MEDIUM": "游리",
            "HIGH": "游댮",
        }
        return f"{emoji[self.severity]}"

    @property
    def formatted_score(self) -> str:
        emoji = {
            "LGTM": "游녨",
            "Nitpicks": "游뱁",
            "Needs Some Work": "游댢",
            "Needs a Lot of Work": "游뚿",
        }
        return f"{self.score} {emoji[self.score]}"
```


Remove dead code and comments referencing 'formatted_severity' and 'formatted_score' properties, as all formatting is now handled by the formatter classes. Cleaning this improves maintainability and clarity.

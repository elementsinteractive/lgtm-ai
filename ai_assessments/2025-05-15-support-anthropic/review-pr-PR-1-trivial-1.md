**Summary:**

This PR is a simple maintenance update that updates the cruft template commit reference and adjusts the pre-commit hook configuration to use standard Git hook naming conventions ("pre-push" instead of "push" and "pre-commit" instead of "commit"). These changes align with proper Git hook naming practices and improve the maintenance of the project infrastructure. The changes are straightforward and don't introduce any issues.

🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

This PR is a simple chore update that changes the Cruft commit hash and updates two hook names in the pre-commit config (changing "push" to "pre-push" and "commit" to "pre-commit"). These are minor maintenance changes that help keep the repository up-to-date and aligned with best practices. The changes look good and there are no issues to address.

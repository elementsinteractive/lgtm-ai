**Summary:**

This PR looks good. It's a simple update of the cruft commit reference and minor changes to the pre-commit configuration, changing hooks from "push" to "pre-push" and from "commit" to "pre-commit". These types of maintenance changes help keep the development environment consistent and up-to-date.

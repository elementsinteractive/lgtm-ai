🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

This PR updates the commit hash in the `.cruft.json` file and modifies the pre-commit configuration to enhance the workflow. Specifically, the pre-commit stage has been changed from `push` to `pre-push`, aligning the hooks to run earlier in the process. Overall, these changes seem effective but require validation within the context of your project's workflow to ensure compatibility. Ensure the update to the `.cruft.json` is necessary by confirming upstream differences are relevant, and double-check that the pre-push alterations meet all workflow requirements without introducing gaps in checks.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🟡 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3`




```yaml
-  - "push"
+  - "pre-push"
```


The change from `push` to `pre-push` is noteworthy; verify that this change fits the workflow and does not unintentionally bypass necessary checks.

ðŸ¦‰ **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Needs Work ðŸ”§

**Summary:**

The PR adds functionality to schedule tasks using Celery Beat and introduces Django management commands for loading images. While these additions are valuable, there are some issues with correctness and code quality that need to be addressed. Specifically, the handling of invalid URLs in the function `get_content` should be improved to prevent errors when `None` is passed to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. Also, there is a minor redundancy in the code that could be cleaned up.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Correctness]** ðŸ”´ `src/images/tasks.py:48`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


There's a potential issue here. The function `parse_csv` is called if the content is considered valid, but if `get_content` returns `None` (in case of an invalid URL), `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` will throw an error since it expects a list, not `None`. Make sure `content` is not `None` before passing it to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


It's redundant to set `url = url` here. The function parameter already has the name `url`. Unnecessary assignments should be removed to maintain code clarity.

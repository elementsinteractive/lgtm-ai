# Review for PR: PR-2-quality

> Sample 2

> Using model: gpt-4o


ü¶â **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM üëç

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a new formatting system for code reviews, specifically implementing Markdown and Terminal formats. It utilizes Python's typing and Pydantic for data modeling, showing clear organization and separation of concerns. The constants for score and severity mappings enhance code readability and maintainability, while the formatter integration allows for potential future extensions.

The tests are robust, thoroughly covering formatter functionality and various comment scenarios. However, some minor quality issues, such as syntactic consistency and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines, are present. Suggest focusing on:
1. Consolidating duplicated import statements for better readability.
2. Maintaining a consistent import style according to PEP 8 standards.

Overall, the PR is well-structured and functional, with attention to minor code style aspects needed to align with Python best practices.

**Specific Comments:**

- ü¶â **[Quality]** üîµ `scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py:8`




```Python
from lgtm.formatters.markdown import MarkDownFormatter
```


Consider consolidating import statements from the same module to improve organization and readability. There are multiple imports from `lgtm.formatters` which could be reduced to fewer lines.

- ü¶â **[Quality]** üîµ `src/lgtm/__main__.py:7`




```Python
import gitlab
from lgtm.ai.agent import get_basic_agent
from lgtm.base.schemas import PRUrl
from lgtm.formatters.markdown import MarkDownFormatter
from lgtm.formatters.terminal import TerminalFormatter
```


Ensure consistent import order to comply with PEP 8. Consider adding a blank line to separate third-party imports from local application imports.

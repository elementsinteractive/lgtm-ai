**Summary:**

This pull request aims to add new functionality through Celery task scheduling for loading images, provide a Django management command to execute this task manually, and include a test for the management command. Overall, the approach to extending functionality is appropriate, however, there are critical issues that need to be addressed concerning correctness. Additionally, the testing is not comprehensive enough to ensure the new features perform correctly in all scenarios. Before merging, it's crucial to resolve these issues, particularly around error handling.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:35`




```python
url = url
validate = URLValidator()
try:
    validate(url)
except ValidationError:
    return None
```


The `get_content` function should check if the `url` variable is None before attempting to use the URL validator. If it's None, the current implementation will pass it to the validator, resulting in an exception that's not handled. The function should ideally check if `url` is None and return immediately.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:17`




```python
reader = csv.DictReader(content)
```


The function `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` should validate that `content` is not None before proceeding with processing the CSV data. Passing None to `csv.DictReader` will result in a TypeError.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:38`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


It's good practice to handle possible HTTP errors here, like timeouts or connection errors. Consider using exceptions like `httpx.HTTPStatusError` to catch failed status codes, and `httpx.RequestError` for other network-related exceptions to improve the robustness of `get_content`.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:15`




```python
assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


The test currently only verifies that the command outputs "Done"; it does not actually test if the images are loaded as expected. Consider adding assertions to verify the actual effect of running `load_images`, such as checking database records.

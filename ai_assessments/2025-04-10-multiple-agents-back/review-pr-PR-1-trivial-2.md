🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

The PR updates the `.cruft.json` file with a new commit hash, which appears to integrate recent changes or improvements from the template's repository. Additionally, the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file has been modified for better clarity by updating the stages from "push" to "pre-push" and from "commit" to "pre-commit". While these changes seem technically correct, the lack of contextual comments on why the specific updates were made may hinder understanding for the reviewers and future maintainers. Adding a brief explanation in the PR description would enhance the clarity of the changes significantly.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:4`

Consider adding a comment or explanation in the PR description or commit message about why the stages have been updated to "pre-push" and "pre-commit". This can help reviewers and future maintainers understand the intention behind the change more clearly.

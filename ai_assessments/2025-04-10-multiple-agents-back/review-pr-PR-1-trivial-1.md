🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

The PR updates two configuration files: `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The former contains a simple commit reference change, while the latter modifies the stages for hooks, shifting from 'push' to 'pre-push', and changing a hook's stage from 'commit' to 'pre-commit'. These configuration changes are appropriate but need to be verified against the project's CI/CD processes and team workflows for seamless integration. Ensure the changes correspond with the intended version control and commit-linting strategies.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3`




```YAML
default_stages:
  - "push"
+  - "pre-push"
```


The update from 'push' to 'pre-push' is fine, but you must ensure this aligns with your CI/CD trigger points. This change will mean hooks will run before you push the code rather than at the actual push time.

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:13`




```YAML
stages:
- "commit"
+ "pre-commit"
```


Changing the stage from 'commit' to 'pre-commit' will ensure the '.py' files are formatted before the commits rather than afterwards. Verify this adjustment fits your team's development workflow.

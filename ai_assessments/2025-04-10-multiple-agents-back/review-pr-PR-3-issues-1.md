**Summary:**

The PR enhances the Django settings by integrating a Celery beat schedule for periodic image loading. It also includes a Django management command and a Celery task to perform this image loading, alongside a test case to verify management command execution. The code is functionally on point, but several improvements are necessary concerning error handling, type annotations, and clarity regarding deprecated functionality. Attention to these details will enhance maintainability and reliability.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:38`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


Ensure the `get_content` function handles scenarios where the response status code is not 200. Log an error or raise an exception for better debuggability instead of returning `None` silently when there are HTTP errors.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:27`




```python
def get_content(url: str | None) -> list[str] | None:
```


The current type annotations with '|' are not compatible with Python versions before 3.10. To ensure backward compatibility, use `Union[str, None]` from the `typing` module.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:7`




```python
"Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
"Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
```


The help message indicates that the command is deprecated. It's advisable to either remove this command if it's not needed or provide comprehensive documentation outlining its current role and utility to avoid confusion.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
parse_csv(content)
```


Add error handling around the `parse_csv` invocation to prevent the complete failure of the task if a single record parsing fails. This enables logging the error and processing valid records, improving robustness.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:3`




```python
import pytest
from django.core.management import call_command
```


Expand test coverage to include edge cases where `load_images` might fail due to exceptions or invalid input. This will help in improving the overall robustness of the task.

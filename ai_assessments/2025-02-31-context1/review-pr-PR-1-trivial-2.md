**Summary:**

The changes in this PR are straightforward and involve configuration updates. The .cruft.json file simply updates the commit hash for the template, which likely points to an updated version of the pypackage-skeleton being used. This seems like a standard update without any issues. 

The .pre-commit-config.yaml changes the default stages for certain hooks from "push" to "pre-push" and updates a specific hook's stage from "commit" to "pre-commit". These changes are typical when aligning the stages with where you want the checks to occur. 

Overall, there are no corrections needed in terms of functionality or logic, as these are configuration modifications. The code quality seems good, but it's always beneficial to ensure that everyone on the team is aware of these configuration stage changes, as it affects when the hooks are executed. Furthermore, no testing scripts are involved since these are configuration changes, but it might be worthwhile to treat the actual pipeline as a test procedure when these changes are introduced.

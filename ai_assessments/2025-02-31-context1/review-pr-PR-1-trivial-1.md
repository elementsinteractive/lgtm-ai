**Summary:**

The PR mainly updates the commit hash and adjusts the pre-commit configuration. These changes appear minor but serve to update dependencies or templates and refine the pre-commit process. The change in the commit hash in the `.cruft.json` file is likely intended to align with the latest template version, which is good for staying up to date. Meanwhile, updates in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` involve ensuring that the correct stages are specified for hooks, aligning with standard usage patterns.

However, it's always a good practice to provide context or mention in the PR description about the purpose of updating the commit hash and any significant changes it brings from the template repository.

Overall, these changes appear correct, but it's essential to ensure that any updates do not disrupt current workflows.

**Summary:**

The PR introduces several changes adding new functionalities, primarily a Celery task setup and a Django management command to load images. While the code is mostly sound, there are some areas for improvement in terms of error handling, code clarity, and testing. The settings.py refactor is concise, the task implementation is good, but might miss potential edge cases. Management command works but can be improved. Tests lack comprehensive coverage.

**Summary of Required Changes:**
1. Improve error handling in `get_content()` function.
2. Enhance code quality by removing redundant lines in `get_content()`.
3. Add more tests to cover various scenarios, especially for edge cases in the task and command implementations.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:35` The line `url = url` is redundant and should be removed for cleaner code. It doesn't serve any purpose here.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:38` Consider adding logging or more nuanced error handling to give insights into why validation failed rather than silently returning `None`.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:42` Handling network exceptions like connection errors can prevent the task from failing silently or terminating unexpectedly. Consider wrapping the request in a try-except block and possibly retrying or logging failures.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댮 `tests/images/test_commands.py:11` It would be beneficial to include tests that validate actual functionality, like ensuring database changes when the command is executed, and testing different scenarios including error cases.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:16` This assertion merely checks for command output consistency and not the side effects. Consider adding tests that validate side effects, including interactions with the database and handling of varied input data.

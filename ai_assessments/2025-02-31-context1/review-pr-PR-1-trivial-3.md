**Summary:**

The changes made in this pull request update the commit hash in the `.cruft.json` and modify the stages in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. From the diff and the provided context, these changes appear to be related to maintaining consistency with underlying tooling setups, particularly for pre-commit hooks.

Overall, the changes are straightforward and do not introduce any functionality changes or bugs. However, it's important to ensure that modifying the default stages in the pre-commit configuration aligns with the team's workflow and does not disrupt existing processes.

I see no issues with the updated commit hash as long as it corresponds to the intended template changes.

The code does not introduce any new runtime code, so there is no necessity for additional testing beyond verifying that the pre-commit hooks trigger appropriately.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:1` Ensure that changing the default hook types from 'push' to 'pre-push' aligns with the intended usage and workflow of your team. This change will trigger the pre-push hooks instead of on pushes, which might affect the current usage patterns.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:11` By changing the stages from 'commit' to 'pre-commit', make sure that it does not disrupt your pre-existing commit workflows, especially if other team members rely on the previous configuration. It's useful to communicate these changes to the team.

Moreover, ensure that the updated configuration is tested by actuating a sample commit and observing if the pre-commit hook works as expected.

**Summary:**

The refactoring and enhancements introduced in this PR are generally beneficial, improving the code structure by using formatters, which allow for more flexible presentation of review data. The introduction of literals for severity, category, and score, along with helper functions for mapping, is a positive change as it enhances readability and maintainability. Also, unnecessary code related to formatting has been removed, like `formatted_score` and `formatted_severity`, which aligns with single responsibility principles. Furthermore, the integration of `rich` library components shows improved handling of console outputs.

However, I have identified a few areas to consider:
1. **Logging:** The `TerminalFormatter` logs a warning when comments are not supported, but this might not be needed every time unless it's a case that should be debugged frequently.
2. **Type Annotations:** Consider specifying more precise typing in methods like `format_comments_section` where `comments` is marked as a list but can be `None`. If `None` is a valid input, this should be included in the type hint (e.g., `Optional[List[ReviewComment]]`).
3. **Testing Coverage:** The tests cover various scenarios, but it's crucial to ensure that edge cases and all formatter outputs are verified, especially given the significant restructuring. Consider adding more edge case scenarios like handling of a large number of comments or an empty summary.

Overall, the quality of the code after this refactor is good, with some areas for minor improvements.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/formatters/terminal.py:14` Logging a warning here might be excessive unless absolutely necessary for troubleshooting. If this is an expected scenario, consider lowering the log level to `DEBUG`.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/formatters/base.py:16` Consistently specify `Optional` in type hints when a value could be `None`. Here, consider typing as `Optional[List[ReviewComment]]`.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/formatters/test_markdown.py:12` Great to see tests for the formatting functions! Ensure edge cases, like handling of large comments arrays or summaries that are empty or exceptionally large, are well covered too.

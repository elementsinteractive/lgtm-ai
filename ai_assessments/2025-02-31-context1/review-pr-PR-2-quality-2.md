**Summary:**

This pull request improves the codebase by introducing a flexible and maintainable way of formatting review comments using a protocol-based approach. The introduction of `ReviewFormatter` as a protocol and the specific implementations in `MarkDownFormatter` and `TerminalFormatter` allow for a clear separation of concerns and extensibility. Here are the findings and suggestions:

1. **Correctness**: Overall, the code changes appear correct and function as expected based on the provided context and tests.

2. **Code Quality**: 
   - The refactoring of severity and score literals to centralized constants is good for maintainability.
   - Consider removing manual construction of formatted messages in favor of direct usage of the formatter within tests.

3. **Testing**:
   - There is a good amount of test coverage for the new formatter logic, especially in `test_markdown.py` and `test_gitlab.py`.
   - Consider adding edge case tests for more unusual inputs to ensure robust handling.

No major issues, but make sure to consider additional edge case tests.

Overall, this is a clean and maintainable change, and the introduction of formatters will allow for easy expansions and adjustments in the future.


**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/__main__.py:75` Consider using `TerminalFormatter().format_summary_section` to maintain consistency with the new formatter architecture.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/git_client/test_gitlab.py:1` Consider restructuring to use actual formatter implementations directly in the test to ensure tests are built around the components as they are used in production.

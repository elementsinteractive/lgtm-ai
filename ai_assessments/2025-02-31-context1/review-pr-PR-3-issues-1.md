**Summary:**

Overall, the PR introduces several enhancements and new features to the codebase, including the integration of Celery for task scheduling and a new management command to load images. The code is generally well-written but contains a few areas that require improvement in terms of correctness and potential functionality issues.

1. **Correctness**:
   - The `get_content` function lacks an explicit return statement when the HTTP request is unsuccessful, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the caller expects a list in all cases.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - There is room for improvement in logging and error handling. Adding logs and handling exceptions in a more detailed manner would increase the maintainability of the system.

3. **Testing**:
   - Additional tests should be created to cover a broader range of edge cases, such as when the CSV doesn't contain valid records or when the HTTP response status code is not 200.

Improvements in these areas will enhance the robustness and reliability of the application.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:44` The `get_content` function should have an explicit return statement (e.g., `return None`) in case the HTTP status code is not 200. This will make the function's behavior more predictable.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:43` Consider adding logging to capture the URL being fetched and the response status. This will assist in troubleshooting issues related to failed content loading.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:48` Catch exceptions from `httpx.get` (like `httpx.RequestError`) to handle network-related errors gracefully, possibly with a retry mechanism.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:0` Tests should also consider edge cases such as the CSV not containing any valid records or when `get_content` fetches an invalid URL resulting in a validation error or a bad HTTP response.

**Summary:**

The code introduces several key additions, including a Celery task scheduler, a new Django management command and some task-related functions. Overall, the code is mostly well-structured and integrates with existing functionality. However, there are areas that could use some improvement:

1. **Correctness**: 
   - The `get_content` function lacks a check for the result of the HTTP request, particularly when handling content that cannot be retrieved due to issues other than a 200 response.

2. **Quality**: 
   - The newly added code should follow consistent error handling and logging strategies, especially around critical operations like network requests.

3. **Testing**: 
   - Additional tests should be included to cover edge cases, particularly for scenarios where the `get_content` might fail to retrieve the CSV correctly or returns improper data.

I suggest addressing these issues by adding a few error messages and loggings, conducting unsafe operation checks, and consolidating testing for edge cases.


**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:44` In addition to checking the status code, it would be beneficial to handle potential exceptions that might arise during the HTTP request, such as network issues. Implementing a try-except block for the httpx.get() request can also ensure better error handling.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:46` Consider adding logging when the content is successfully retrieved or when it fails. It helps in debugging and auditing purposes.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8` It's good practice to include tests for edge cases. In this case, consider testing the command when load_images raises an exception or when the content retrieval fails.

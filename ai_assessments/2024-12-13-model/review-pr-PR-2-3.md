## Summary

> The code enhancements primarily focus on implementing logging across various parts of the application for better debugging and traceability. A custom exception class `LGMTException` has been introduced, inheriting from `ClickException`, and existing exception classes now inherit from this new class. This encourages a more cohesive and consistent exception handling approach.

The logging setup includes setting levels based on verbosity and integrating with `RichHandler` for rich formatting of logs, which is useful for better readability during console outputs.

A new test has been introduced for verifying the logging levels based on verbosity, covering different verbosity scenarios, ensuring that the application's logging configuration can be accurately controlled via command-line options.

In terms of structure, there's a notable move of `schemas` to a `base` directory, indicating a possibly more modular design approach. This requires existing imports to be updated, which has been correctly executed here.

Major improvements include modular logging, better exception handling strategy, and expanded test coverage for logging behavior. The refactoring also seems to align with the larger architecture and design principles but requires minor tweaks for consistency. The logging setup should ensure correct usage of existing loggers by default settings to prevent verbose logs in production by mistake.

Issues found are mostly related to ensuring the application does not degrade due to excessive logging in production by mistakes in verbosity settings and validating that all new functionality (primarily logging) is well-tested. Suggested changes involve refining logging levels and ensuring consistent logger usage across newly added components to follow DRY principles.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/lgtm/__main__.py:73: The logger and logging configurations are set with `RichHandler`, which is generally fine for local and development environments. Ensure that different environments (e.g., production) can tailor logging behaviors to avoid verbose logs in production inadvertently.

- Comment: src/lgtm/base/exceptions.py:4: The initialization of `LGMTException` appears appropriate since it incorporates logging for both debug and error levels, which gives flexibility when the exception is triggered.

- Comment: src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py:141: Consider evaluating the caching strategy for `_get_pr_from_url`, especially how cache invalidation might affect fetching mechanisms, to prevent stale data issues.

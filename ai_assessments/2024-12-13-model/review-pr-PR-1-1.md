## Summary

> The overall implementation focuses on improving the import and storage of image data. The refactoring of services into a batch process with a serializer-specific class improves code organization and data handling efficiency. Moreover, the introduction of batch size control through environments adds flexibility. However, some areas require attention:

1. The migration combines two functionalities (adding `image_id` and creating indexes) within an initial migration, which could cause issues if there's any inconsistencies or data corruption pre-existing.

2. The `image_id` field introduced as `unique` and default `0` can potentially raise integrity errors if not handled specifically during data creation.

3. The `BatchStorageProcedure` handles potential invalid data but does not capture nor log which entries failed validation for further investigation.

4. Test coverage has been improved and refined which is commendable. Maintaining a high level of coverage (95% threshold) ensures reliability moving forward.

The other removed and added files seem part of a substantial refactor and update to accommodate better separation of concerns in code structure, especially for import and processing tasks.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:25: Removing `blank=True` for the `image` field in the same migration may result in validation errors for existing records if the migration is run on a populated database. Consider retaining `blank=True` for backward compatibility or handling existing entries appropriately.

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:30: Adding `unique=True` to `image_id` with a default value of `0` can lead to integrity errors when multiple records are saved with the default value. Consider using `null=True` or removing the default to enforce setting this field explicitly.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:45: Consider logging or collecting errors for further analysis. Knowing which batches failed and why can help diagnose issues when handling data.

## Summary

> The code changes pertain to adding logging functionality across multiple modules, refactoring of exception handling, and relocation of certain schemas. Here's a detailed review:

1. **Logging**: Logging functionalities are introduced across various parts of the application to provide better insight into its execution flow. Various logging levels (debug, info, warning, error) are utilized appropriately. The introduction of `RichHandler` for output formatting is a nice touch.

2. **Refactoring Exceptions**: The refactoring of exceptions to use a centralized exception class (`LGMTException`) enhances consistency, while also enabling logging of exceptions in debug mode. This is a good approach to maintain uniform error handling.

3. **Schema Repositions**: There are several schema imports that have been repositioned, signifying possible structural changes in the project. This seems to be a well-needed refactoring for improved code organization.

4. **Tests**: A test for verifying logging levels has been correctly included. However, the overall testing does not appear extensive given the changes, specifically with respect to testing logging outputs and exception handling.

### Required Changes:
- Review coverage for logging statements needs to be enhanced. Include tests that verify correct logging levels and messages are being used across functions which rely on logging.
- Ensure all possible exceptions, especially those newly refactored or introduced, have corresponding test cases.

Overall, the code is approaching a cleaner architecture with these changes, however, additional work is required to ensure robustness through testing.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment: scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py:5: This logging setup in a script should ideally be moved into a dedicated logging configuration module or function, to adhere to the DRY principle.

- Comment: src/lgtm/ai/agent.py:2: It would be more efficient to initialize the logger outside the function scope if it's used globally within the module.

- Comment: src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py:69: Consider adding a debug log here to print the failed comments.

- Comment: tests/test_main.py:6: Consider adding tests that ensure logging messages are correctly emitted, possibly with a mock logger.

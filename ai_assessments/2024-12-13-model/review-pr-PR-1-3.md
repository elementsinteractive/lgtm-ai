## Summary

> The code introduces a new procedure for bulk creating images from external sources using data importers and resource pullers/loaders, bringing structured improvements and better handling of large datasets with chunking. Several migrations and test files were updated or removed, indicating integration with a bulk processing system. However, there are a few areas that need attention.

Major issues noted include removal of optional URLField blank attribute without clear justification, potential indexing issues on model migrations, and the test coverage might be lacking despite an increase in coverage threshold. Consider addressing these.

In summary, the code could benefit from detailed documentation on the rationale behind the database changes, especially around the index creation and their necessity. Also, clarification of tests coverage would improve confidence in reliability.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:28: It is unclear why the `blank=True` constraint was removed from the `image` field. If images can be optional, this might lead to unexpected issues.

- Comment: src/images/models.py:5: The removal of `blank=True` in URLField may lead to validation issues or regressions if the image field needs to remain optional. It's important to verify whether this change is intentional and understand its impact thoroughly.

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:18: The `image_id` uniqueness could lead to issues if `image_id` is always set to the default 0. Ensure that `image_id` is assigned correctly and uniquely before saving records.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:3: Consider adding more detailed logging within the `BatchStorageProcedure` class, especially to track errors and retries.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:7: The `importer` function does not return any value or provide feedback about its execution. Consider providing some feedback or exceptions if the import process fails.

- Comment: src/images/serializers.py:12: While normalization functions are useful, it would be beneficial for documentation or comments to specify their purpose or intended transformation behavior.

- Comment: tests/images/test_serializers.py:31: The use of `@override_settings` is good for isolated test runs, ensure it is used consistently where required to change settings like batch sizes in tests.

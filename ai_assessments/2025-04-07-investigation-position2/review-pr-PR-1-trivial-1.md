**Summary:**

The PR makes two changes: updates the commit hash in the `.cruft.json` file and changes the stages for hooks in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. These changes are likely intended for dependency management and maintaining the code quality through pre-commit hooks. However, the commit hash update should be verified for any implications it might have. The changes in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file improve the clarity and proper setup for pre-commit hooks, ensuring linting and formatting are only activated on relevant stages. There are no explicit correctness or quality issues identified, but further context regarding the commit hash update would be beneficial. Tests are not applicable in this case as these changes focus on configuration files, which are meant to ensure quality through automation tools.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Correctness]** ðŸŸ¡ `.cruft.json`




```json
"commit": "381fcbbe5e4048233208117a779a5ac8e26a6dba",
```


Verify the commit hash update is intentional and compatible with the current project setup. Ensure the new commit does not introduce breaking changes or incompatibilities.

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `.pre-commit-config.yaml`




```yaml
- "pre-commit"
```


Good improvement by refining stage activations: using `pre-commit` instead of `commit` ensures the hooks are correctly triggered at the expected project stage.

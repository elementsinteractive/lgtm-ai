🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

The PR includes changes to update the commit reference in the .cruft.json file and to update the stages in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file from "push" to "pre-push" and "commit" to "pre-commit" respectively. This ensures that the pre-commit hooks are correctly defined and aligned with the intended usage stages. The changes seem minor but crucial for the correct enforcement of code quality checks and formatting. There are no functional issues introduced, and the modifications appear appropriately contextualized and do not introduce inconsistencies or errors. Overall, the changes are straightforward and align with best practices for configuration management in pre-commit setups. However, ensure that your team is aware of these stage changes if they affect existing workflows.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml`




```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
```


Change from "push" to "pre-push" ensures that the hooks run before code is pushed to any branch, right at the pre-push stage. This is often desirable to catch issues before they leave the local environment.

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml`




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


Changing the stage from "commit" to "pre-commit" ensures that these hooks are triggered before commits are finalized, allowing for issues to be resolved before they are introduced into the codebase.

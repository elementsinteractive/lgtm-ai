**Summary:**

### PR Review Summary
The code changes introduce a flexible and extensible way to format code review responses by creating various formatters like `MarkDownFormatter` and `TerminalFormatter`. The changes appear to be conducted with good consideration of separation of concerns and advantages of using type protocols for defining expected behavior. The approach refactor decouples formatting concerns from core logic, improving maintainability and allowing for future extensions.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Ensure that all edge cases for formatting are handled.
- Enhance verification of correctness in tests by covering potential exceptions or unsupported operations, especially for terminal formatting sections.

Overall, it looks well-structured and effectively leverages Python's typing and class inheritance features. A few additional tests would ensure robustness and reliability.


**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/ai/schemas.py`




```python
CommentCategory = Literal["Correctness", "Quality", "Testing"]
```


Good use of type aliases (`CommentCategory`, `CommentSeverity`, and `ReviewScore`) for clarity and reducing repetitions across the code base.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py`




```python
os.mkdir(output_directory)
```


Considering adding exception handling around os.mkdir to catch `FileExistsError` in case the directory already exists.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/ai/schemas.py`




```python
emoji = {
    "LOW": "游댯",
    "MEDIUM": "游리",
    "HIGH": "游댮",
}
```


Refactoring out `formatted_severity` and `formatted_score` methods in favor of constants file is a good move towards cleaner and centralized configuration management for display elements.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py`




```python
pr.notes.create({"body": self._get_summary_body(review, failed_comments)})
```


Ensure that when creating the notes, there is a fallback for cases when API fails to post, possibly logging those separately to ensure no data is lost.:56

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/__main__.py`




```python
print(terminal_formatter.format_summary_section(review))
```


Great to see these formatters being utilized here. It may be wise to validate that all models of TerminalFormatter return the expected types before proceeding for a better user experience.:69

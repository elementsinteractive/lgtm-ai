**Summary:**

The code introduces a structured approach for formatting review outputs using different formatters (Markdown, Terminal) by implementing a formatter protocol. This change enhances flexibility and maintainability in output formatting. The application of formatting is well-integrated within the components like the GitLab client and the CLI application, ensuring consistency across various outputs. The tests appear comprehensive in validating formatter functionality and GitLab client's interaction with formatters, ensuring confidence in code correctness.

There are several improvements and nitpicks suggested with their corresponding line comments.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py`




```python
os.mkdir(output_directory)
```


When creating directories, it's better to use `os.makedirs()` with `exist_ok=True` to avoid potential errors when directories already exist, especially if the script is rerun.

```python
os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py`




```python
click.Abort()
```


Using `click.Abort()` might not execute as expected because it is not called. Instead, `raise click.Abort()` should be used to correctly raise the exception.

```python
raise click.Abort()
```

```python
def format_summary_section(self, review: Review, comments: list[ReviewComment] | None = None) -> _T: ...
```


Consider adding "raise NotImplementedError" in the methods to ensure that any subclass must implement these methods.

```python
def format_summary_section(self, review: Review, comments: list[ReviewComment] | None = None) -> _T:
    raise NotImplementedError
```

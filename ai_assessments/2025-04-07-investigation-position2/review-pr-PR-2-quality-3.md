**Summary:**

Overall, this PR makes the code more modular by introducing a formatter design pattern which abstracts the formatting of reviews. It implements different formatters to export reviews in markdown or terminal output. The introduction of the `ReviewFormatter` interface and specific formatter classes (`MarkDownFormatter`, `TerminalFormatter`) enhances the flexibility and maintainability of your code. This is a positive move as it separates concerns and allows for different display implementations without altering the core logic.

The code changes are mostly correct with proper usage of types, Pydantic models, and restructuring logic to make them more reusable. Furthermore, the inclusion of `Final` for immutable global constants in `constants.py` is a good practice to prevent accidental modifications.

Testing is adequately addressed by adding tests for each critical functionality. However, the test coverage for different edge cases, particularly in terms of exception handling within the formatter methods, could be enhanced.

Nevertheless, this PR introduces a few issues that need to be addressed:
- On testing: Enhance test coverage to ensure edge cases are handled gracefully, particularly for error scenarios involving the formatter logic.
- Code quality: The imports could be cleaned up to avoid unused imports, which is a minor issue but can improve readability.

Minor refactoring of existing tests to adapt to the new structure is correctly handled and the use of mock objects helps in simulating scenarios for unit testing.

Recommendation: Review the error handling mechanism within formatter implementations and ensure coverage for various edge cases to strengthen the robustness of tests.

```python

There are unused imports like `os` and `get_args` in this file. These should be removed to clean up the code and improve readability.

It's essential to ensure that testing also addresses any potential exceptions raised by the format methods, particularly those involving external dependencies or varying input data. Consider extending the tests to cover such edge cases.

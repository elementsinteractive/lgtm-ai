**Summary:**

The code introduces several new features and minor improvements, such as new management commands and Celery task scheduling. However, there are areas that require attention:

1. **Correctness**: There is a bug in the `get_content` function in `tasks.py`, where it might attempt to read from a `None` content in `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`, potentially leading to issues.

2. **Quality**: The code structure is mostly good, but consider renaming certain methods and improving error handling as specified in the comments below.

3. **Testing**: More comprehensive tests are needed, especially to verify the behavior of `load_images` under various conditions, like invalid URL, network failures, and empty content.

Please review the specific comments for detailed suggestions and fixes.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


In the `get_content` function, the line `content = get_content(...)` might return `None` if the URL is invalid, leading the subsequent call to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` and `parse_csv` with `None`. You need to handle this scenario appropriately to avoid exceptions.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py`




```python
if any(
    (
        (title := entry.get("title")),
        (description := entry.get("description")),
        (image := entry["image"]),
    )
):
```


Consider using more explicit variable names. For example, the variables in the `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function could be more descriptive to reflect their role.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py`




```python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "images.management.commands.load_images.load_images",
        lambda *args, **kwargs: None,
    )
    out = StringIO()

    call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

    assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


The test for the `load_images` command checks its execution but doesn't validate if images are actually loaded. Consider adding further tests to simulate loading and verifying database changes.

**Summary:**

This pull request involves two primary changes: updating the commit hash in the `.cruft.json` file and modifying the stages for hooks in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. The commit hash change in `.cruft.json` reflects a new baseline for the project template and doesn't affect functionality directly. 

The changes in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` adjust the default install hooks and stages for pre-push and pre-commit operations. The code provided adjusts the default stage from 'push' to 'pre-push' and modifies the `stages` for the `format-code` hook from `commit` to `pre-commit`. These changes ensure that code formatting is enforced at the pre-commit stage, which can help catch formatting issues earlier in the development process.

Overall, the changes appear purposeful and correct. The modifications improve code quality practices by ensuring that code is formatted properly before committing. No additional testing is needed as these are configuration changes for commit hooks.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `.pre-commit-config.yaml`




```YAML
  - "pre-push"
repos:
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: lint
        name: Lint Code
```


The `format-code` hook is now set to run at `pre-commit` instead of `commit`. This ensures that code is consistently formatted before the code is actually committed, which is a standard practice to maintain code quality from the get-go. A sound move that will help catch formatting issues earlier.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `.cruft.json`




```JSON
  "commit": "381fcbbe5e4048233208117a779a5ac8e26a6dba"
```


The commit hash in `.cruft.json` has been updated. Ensure this is in sync with the latest updates and purpose of this baseline change. As part of a standard procedure, verify that relevant details in the newly pointed commit align with the project's development objectives.

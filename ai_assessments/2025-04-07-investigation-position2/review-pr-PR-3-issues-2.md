**Summary:**

The PR introduces a Django management command to load images, adds a periodic task with Celery, and tests for the command. The code is generally well-structured but has some areas for improvement.

1. Correctness: The tasks for loading images and checking CSV should handle edge cases, like missing or malformed CSV files. Ensure error handling is robust.
2. Code Quality: There's redundant code that can be cleaned up, especially in the `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function. Consider clearer naming conventions and remove redundant variable assignments.
3. Testing: There is a basic test for the management command, but it needs more coverage to include scenarios where the task may fail due to invalid URLs or content retrieval failures.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py`




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


Ensure `content` is checked for being None before processing, to avoid potential errors if the CSV URL is invalid or `get_content` returns None.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py`




```python
if any(
    (
        (title := entry.get("title")),
        (description := entry.get("description")),
        (image := entry["image"]),
    )
):
    if any((title, description, image)):
        return True
```


The check `if any((title, description, image)):` is redundant after using the same condition in the preceding code. Consider simplifying this function.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py`




```python
url = url
```


The assignment `url = url` is unnecessary and can be removed.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py`

Consider adding tests for failure cases, such as invalid CSV URLs or missing content to better ensure robustness.

## Review Summary

This PR updates the cruft template commit hash and refines the pre-commit configuration by making stage names more explicit. The changes are minimal and straightforward:

1. **Cruft update**: The template commit reference is updated from `82cc6d2` to `381fcbb`
2. **Pre-commit configuration**: Stage names are changed from abbreviated forms (`push`, `commit`) to their full names (`pre-push`, `pre-commit`)

The changes improve clarity and consistency in the pre-commit configuration by using the official Git hook names rather than potential abbreviations. This is a routine maintenance/housekeeping PR with no functional impact on the codebase logic.

**Overall Assessment**: The changes are correct and improve configuration consistency. This is a clean maintenance update with no issues identified.

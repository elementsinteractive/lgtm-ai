## Summary

This PR successfully refactors formatting logic out of the GitLab client and main modules into a dedicated `formatters` package. The implementation follows good software design principles with a proper Protocol-based abstraction layer, making the code more maintainable and extensible for future integrations (e.g., GitHub).

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns between formatting and business logic
- Well-designed Protocol interface that supports multiple formatter implementations
- Type-safe generic implementation with proper variance
- Comprehensive test coverage for the new formatters
- Constants properly extracted to a separate module

**Areas for minor improvement:**
- One inconsistency in emoji mapping (LOW severity emoji changed from green to blue)
- Protocol methods could benefit from additional docstrings
- Terminal formatter behavior when comments are passed could be more explicit

Overall, this is a well-executed refactoring that improves code quality and maintainability with only minor nitpicks.


**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
    "LOW": "🔵",
`````


The emoji for LOW severity has changed from "🟢" (green circle) to "🔵" (blue circle). This changes the visual representation users may be accustomed to. If this was intentional to better distinguish LOW from MEDIUM (which is yellow), consider documenting this change.




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
    def format_comments_section(self, comments: list[ReviewComment]) -> _T: ...

    def format_comment(self, comment: ReviewComment) -> _T: ...
`````


The Protocol methods `format_comments_section` and `format_comment` should have docstrings similar to `format_summary_section` for consistency. While ellipsis-based Protocol methods are valid, adding docstrings would improve documentation and IDE support.



`````suggestion
    def format_comments_section(self, comments: list[ReviewComment]) -> _T:
        """Format the comments section of the review.
        
        Args:

    def format_comment(self, comment: ReviewComment) -> _T:
        """Format a single review comment.

            The formatted comment.

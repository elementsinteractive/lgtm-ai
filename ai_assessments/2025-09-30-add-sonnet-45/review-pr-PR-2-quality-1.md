## Summary

This is a well-executed refactoring that successfully separates formatting concerns from the Git client implementation. The changes introduce a clean abstraction layer through the `ReviewFormatter` protocol, making the codebase more modular and extensible for future integrations (e.g., GitHub).

**Key improvements:**
- Extracted formatting logic into a dedicated `formatters` module with a Protocol-based interface
- Created separate `MarkDownFormatter` and `TerminalFormatter` implementations
- Moved emoji/formatting constants to a centralized location
- Removed computed fields from Pydantic models (formatting is now a presentation concern)
- Updated all consumers to use the new formatter pattern

**Quality observations:**
- The refactoring maintains backward compatibility in behavior
- Tests have been properly updated and extended
- The Protocol pattern provides good type safety while maintaining flexibility
- Code is cleaner and follows separation of concerns

**Minor issues:**
- One inconsistency in emoji constants (🔵 vs 🟢 for LOW severity)
- The `comments` parameter in `format_summary_section` could be more clearly documented regarding when it should be used vs `review.review_response.comments`

Overall, this is a solid refactoring that improves the codebase's maintainability and extensibility.


**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
    "LOW": "🔵",
`````


There's an inconsistency with the emoji used for LOW severity. This file uses 🔵 (blue circle), but the old code in `schemas.py` used 🟢 (green circle). This could be a visual regression for users familiar with the old color scheme. Please verify if this change was intentional or if it should be reverted to 🟢 for consistency.



`````Python
    "LOW": "🟢",
`````




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
            comments: The comments that were generated during the review and need to be displayed in the general summary section.
`````


The purpose of the `comments` parameter in `format_summary_section` is somewhat unclear from the documentation. It appears this is meant for "failed comments" that couldn't be posted inline (based on usage in gitlab.py), but the docstring describes it generically. Consider clarifying when this parameter should be used versus accessing `review.review_response.comments` directly, as this distinction is important for implementers of the protocol.



`````suggestion
            comments: Optional list of comments that should be displayed in the summary section. Typically used for comments that failed to be posted inline (e.g., due to API limitations). If None, the summary is displayed without a comment list.
`````

### 🔍 Summary

## Summary

This PR implements a scheduled Celery task to process CSV files and load images into the database. The implementation includes a Celery Beat schedule, a Django management command, and the core task logic.

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Validation logic bug**: The `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function has redundant nested `any()` checks and inconsistent field access patterns that could cause KeyError exceptions.

2. **Missing error handling**: HTTP requests lack exception handling for network errors and timeouts. Additionally, `load_images` doesn't check if `get_content` returns `None` before using it.

3. **Data loss risk**: All existing images are deleted before validating that CSV parsing succeeds. If parsing fails after deletion, all data is lost without recovery.

**Required Changes:**
- Fix the validation logic to use consistent field access and remove redundant checks
- Add proper error handling for HTTP requests and null value checks
- Implement atomic database operations using transactions to prevent data loss
- Add timeout configuration for HTTP requests
- Expand test coverage beyond simple command execution

The core approach is sound, but these issues need to be addressed before the PR can be safely merged.


**Specific Comments:**

`````python
if any(
    (
        (title := entry.get("title")),
        (description := entry.get("description")),
        (image := entry["image"]),
    )
):
    if any((title, description, image)):
        return True
`````


**Critical: Redundant validation logic with inconsistent field access**

This validation has two issues:
1. The outer `any()` check (lines 19-25) and inner `any()` check (line 26) are redundant - they're checking the same values twice
2. Inconsistent field access: `entry.get()` for title/description vs `entry["image"]` which will raise KeyError if 'image' key is missing

This should be simplified to a single check with consistent field access using `.get()` for all fields.

`````python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
`````


**Missing error handling for HTTP requests**

The `httpx.get()` call can raise exceptions for timeouts, connection errors, and other network issues. These exceptions are not caught, which will cause the task to fail unexpectedly. Additionally, there's no timeout configured, which could cause the task to hang indefinitely.

Wrap this in a try-except block to handle `httpx.HTTPError` and `httpx.TimeoutException`, and add a timeout parameter.



`````Python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30.0)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text.splitlines(True)
except (httpx.HTTPError, httpx.TimeoutException) as e:
    # Log the error or handle appropriately
    return None
`````

`````python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
`````


**Missing null check before validation**

`get_content()` returns `None` when URL validation fails or HTTP request doesn't return 200. This code doesn't check for `None` before calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content)`, which will cause a `TypeError` when the CSV reader tries to iterate over `None`.



`````suggestion
if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
`````




- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴


`````python
Image.objects.all().delete()
parse_csv(content)
`````


**Data loss risk: Deleting all records before validating CSV parsing**

This deletes all existing images before attempting to parse and save the CSV data. If `parse_csv(content)` raises an exception or fails, all existing data will be lost without replacement.

Wrap these operations in a database transaction using `transaction.atomic()` to ensure atomicity - either both operations succeed or neither does.



`````Python
if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    from django.db import transaction
    with transaction.atomic():
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
`````




- #### 🦉 🧪 Testing

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "images.management.commands.load_images.load_images",
        lambda *args, **kwargs: None,
    )
    out = StringIO()

    call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

    assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
`````


**Insufficient test coverage**

This test only verifies that the command executes and returns "Done", but doesn't test the actual logic in `load_images`: HTTP requests, CSV validation, database operations, or error handling. The task is completely mocked out, so no actual code paths are verified.

Consider adding tests that verify the task behavior with different scenarios: valid CSV, invalid CSV, HTTP errors, empty content, etc.




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
url = url
`````


**Redundant self-assignment**

This line assigns `url` to itself, which serves no purpose. It should be removed as it adds no value and creates confusion.

- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
`````


**Inconsistent environment variable naming**

The naming convention is inconsistent: `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` lacks the `CELERY_` prefix while `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR` has it. This makes configuration less intuitive and harder to maintain. Consider standardizing to use the same prefix for both.

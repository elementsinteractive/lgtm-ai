## Summary

This is a well-executed refactoring PR that successfully extracts formatting logic into a dedicated module with a clean protocol-based design. The separation of concerns between formatters (markdown, terminal) and git clients is excellent, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible for future integrations (e.g., GitHub as mentioned in the description).

**Strengths:**
- Clean abstraction with the `ReviewFormatter` protocol
- Good separation of concerns (formatters vs clients)
- Comprehensive test coverage for the new functionality
- Constants properly extracted to a separate module

**Main Issues:**
- Missing required `programming_language` field in `ReviewComment` instantiations across test files (medium severity)
- Minor quality improvements possible in documentation and emoji consistency

The architecture is sound and the refactoring achieves its stated goals without breaking functionality.


**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
ReviewComment(
    comment="comment 1",
    category="Correctness",
    severity="LOW",
    old_path="old_path",
    new_path="new_path",
    line_number=1,
    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
)
`````


Missing required field `programming_language` in ReviewComment instantiation. The ReviewComment schema requires this field, and while tests may pass now, this violates the schema contract and could break if validation becomes stricter or the field is used in formatting logic.



`````suggestion
ReviewComment(
    comment="comment 1",
    category="Correctness",
    severity="LOW",
    old_path="old_path",
    new_path="new_path",
    line_number=1,
    relative_line_number=1,
    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
    programming_language="Python",
)
`````




- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
ReviewComment(
    new_path="foo",
    old_path="foo",
    line_number=1,
    comment="b",
    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
    category="Correctness",
    severity="LOW",
)
`````


Missing required field `programming_language` and `relative_line_number` in ReviewComment instantiation. This pattern appears multiple times in this test file and should be addressed consistently throughout.



`````suggestion
ReviewComment(
    new_path="foo",
    old_path="foo",
    line_number=1,
    comment="b",
    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
    category="Correctness",
    severity="LOW",
    relative_line_number=1,
    programming_language="Python",
)
`````




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
"LOW": "🔵",
`````


Emoji inconsistency: LOW severity uses 🔵 (blue circle) here, but in the removed code from schemas.py it was 🟢 (green circle). This changes the visual representation. Consider whether this was intentional or if consistency should be maintained for users familiar with the previous version.




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
def format_comments_section(self, comments: list[ReviewComment]) -> _T: ...

def format_comment(self, comment: ReviewComment) -> _T: ...
`````


Methods `format_comments_section` and `format_comment` are missing docstrings. For consistency with `format_summary_section` and better protocol documentation, these should have docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

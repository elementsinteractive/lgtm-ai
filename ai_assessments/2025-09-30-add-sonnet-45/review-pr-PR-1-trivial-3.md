### 🔍 Summary

This PR updates the cruft template commit reference and standardizes pre-commit hook stage naming conventions. The changes are minimal and represent routine maintenance work.

**Key changes:**
1. Updates `.cruft.json` to reference a newer template commit (381fcbbe5e4048233208117a779a5ac8e26a6dba)
2. Standardizes hook stage names from `"push"` to `"pre-push"` and `"commit"` to `"pre-commit"` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, which aligns with pre-commit's official naming conventions

The changes are straightforward and correct. The standardization improves consistency with pre-commit framework conventions and ensures proper hook execution timing.

## Summary

This PR updates the cruft template commit hash and corrects pre-commit hook stage naming to follow standard conventions. The changes are minimal and straightforward:

1. **Cruft update**: Updates the template commit reference from `82cc6d2` to `381fcbb`
2. **Pre-commit standardization**: Changes hook stage names from non-standard `"push"` and `"commit"` to standard `"pre-push"` and `"pre-commit"`

The changes improve consistency with pre-commit's standard stage naming conventions, which is a good practice for maintainability and clarity. This is a routine maintenance PR that follows proper configuration standards.

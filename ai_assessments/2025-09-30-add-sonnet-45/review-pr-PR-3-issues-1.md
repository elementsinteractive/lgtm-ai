## Summary

This PR implements a scheduled task to process CSV files and load images into the database. The implementation includes:
- Celery beat schedule configuration to run the task at a specified time
- A Django management command wrapper for the task
- Core logic to fetch CSV from a URL, validate it, and process it

**Critical Issues:**
1. **HIGH severity bug**: `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` has incorrect logic with walrus operators that will not work as intended
2. **MEDIUM severity**: No error handling for HTTP requests, which could cause task failures
3. **MEDIUM severity**: Missing validation that `content` is not None before processing
4. **MEDIUM severity**: Inconsistent use of dictionary access methods could cause KeyError

The approach is sound but needs several corrections before deployment. The testing is minimal and only covers the command execution, not the actual task logic or edge cases.

**Required Changes:**
- Fix the validation logic in `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`
- Add proper error handling for HTTP requests
- Add None check before processing content
- Use consistent dictionary access methods


**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴


`````python
if any(
    (
        (title := entry.get("title")),
        (description := entry.get("description")),
        (image := entry["image"]),
    )
):
    if any((title, description, image)):
        return True
`````


**Critical bug**: This logic is incorrect. The outer `if any(...)` checks whether the assignment expressions themselves are truthy (which they always are as expression objects), not whether the assigned values are truthy. Additionally, the nested `if any((title, description, image))` is redundant and unreachable as intended.

The correct logic should directly check the values without nesting.



`````suggestion
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        title = entry.get("title")
        description = entry.get("description")
        image = entry.get("image")
        if any((title, description, image)):
            return True
    return False
`````




- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
`````


Missing error handling for HTTP requests. If the request times out, encounters a connection error, or any other httpx exception occurs, this will crash the task. Wrap the request in a try-except block and add a timeout for robustness.



`````suggestion
    try:
        response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30.0)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text.splitlines(True)
    except httpx.HTTPError:
        return None
`````




- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
`````


Missing validation: `get_content()` can return `None`, but `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record()` expects a list. This will cause a TypeError if the URL is invalid or the request fails. Check if `content` is None before proceeding.



`````suggestion
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if content is None:
        return
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
`````




- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
(image := entry["image"]),
`````


Using `entry["image"]` (with brackets) will raise a KeyError if the 'image' column doesn't exist, while you use `.get()` for the other fields. This inconsistency could cause crashes. Use `entry.get("image")` for consistency and safety.




- #### 🦉 🧪 Testing

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡


`````python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
`````


The test only verifies that the command executes and returns "Done", but doesn't test any of the actual logic in the `load_images` task. Consider adding tests for:
- `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record()` with various CSV inputs (empty, valid, invalid)
- `get_content()` with valid/invalid URLs and different HTTP responses
- The full `load_images()` task behavior including database operations




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
url = url
`````


This line is redundant - you're assigning `url` to itself. This appears to be leftover code that should be removed.



`````suggestion
    validate = URLValidator()
`````




- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵


`````python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
`````


Consider using `env.int()` with proper type conversion for these values. Currently they default to strings "11" and "1". While crontab accepts both strings and integers, using integers would be more consistent and explicit.



`````suggestion
            minute=env.int("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", 11),
            hour=env.int("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", 1),
`````

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a valuable refactoring by creating a dedicated `formatters` module to handle the presentation of reviews, separating concerns effectively from the core logic and Git client. The implementation using a `ReviewFormatter` protocol is well-designed.

However, there are a few points to address:
- A file (`__init__.py`) appears to have been moved incorrectly from the `tests` directory into `src`.
- Minor improvements can be made to the `TerminalFormatter` regarding unused parameters/warnings.
- Please confirm the intentionality of the emoji change for LOW severity comments.

Overall, good work on the refactoring. Addressing these points will improve the code quality further.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py:1`




```python
# This comment refers to the file move itself, not a specific line.
```


This file seems to have been moved incorrectly from the `tests/` directory to the `src/` directory. An `__init__.py` from a test package should likely not be in the source code under `src/lgtm/formatters/`. Please verify the intended location of this file or remove it if it's unnecessary.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/formatters/terminal.py:16`




```python
            logger.warning("Comments are not supported in the terminal formatter summary section")
```


This warning seems unnecessary. The `format_summary_section` in the `TerminalFormatter` doesn't actually use the `comments` argument, and the main script (`__main__.py`) calls `format_comments_section` separately to display comments in the terminal. If the intention is to never show comments within the summary *panel* itself, perhaps the `comments` argument could be removed from this specific method's signature to avoid confusion, or the warning could be removed as the comments are handled elsewhere.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/formatters/constants.py:6`




```python
    "LOW": "\ud83d\udd35",
```


The emoji for `LOW` severity was changed from Green (`\ud83d\udfe2`) in the old code to Blue (`\ud83d\udd35`). Was this intentional? Green often signifies low severity or passing status, while blue is more neutral. Consider reverting to the green circle or confirming the choice.

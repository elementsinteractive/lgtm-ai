**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Celery task to periodically load image data from a CSV file hosted at a URL specified by an environment variable. It also adds a management command to trigger this task manually and configures Celery Beat for scheduling.

However, the implementation has several critical issues that need addressing before merging:

1.  **Data Loss Risk**: The most significant issue is that the task deletes all existing images *before* attempting to parse the new CSV data. If the parsing fails for any reason (invalid data, network error during fetch, missing file), the system will be left with no images. The deletion should occur only after the new data has been successfully fetched and validated/parsed, ideally within a database transaction.
2.  **Error Handling**: The code lacks robust error handling. It doesn't handle potential network errors when fetching the CSV with `httpx` and doesn't properly handle cases where the source URL might be invalid or the environment variable is missing, potentially leading to `TypeError` or `KeyError`.
3.  **CSV Parsing Safety**: The logic checking the CSV content assumes the presence of specific columns (like 'image'), which could lead to `KeyError` if the CSV format is incorrect.
4.  **Testing**: The added test only verifies that the management command runs, but it completely mocks out the core task logic. Tests covering the actual data loading, validation, error handling, and database interaction are missing.

Minor improvements related to code clarity and Django management command conventions are also suggested.

**Specific Comments:**

```python
        Image.objects.all().delete()
```


Critical Data Loss Risk: The task deletes all existing images using `Image.objects.all().delete()` *before* parsing the fetched CSV content with `parse_csv`. If `parse_csv` fails for any reason (e.g., network issues during fetch, invalid CSV format, validation errors within `parse_csv`), the database will be left empty, leading to data loss. 

Suggestion: Move the deletion logic to *after* the `parse_csv` call succeeds, or ideally, perform the deletion and creation within a database transaction to ensure atomicity.

```python
                (image := entry["image"]),
```


Potential `KeyError`: The code directly accesses `entry["image"]`. If the CSV file is missing the "image" column in its header, this will raise a `KeyError`. Use `.get("image")` to safely access the value, which returns `None` if the key is missing.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


Potential `TypeError`: `get_content` returns `None` if the URL validation fails (e.g., if `os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")` returns `None` or an invalid URL). However, `load_images` passes this potential `None` value directly to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. `csv.DictReader(None)` will raise a `TypeError`. You should check if `content` is not `None` before calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.

Suggestion:
```python
@shared_task
def load_images() -> None:
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if content is None:
        # Log an error or handle the case where content could not be fetched
        print("Error: Could not retrieve content from SRC_FILE") # Replace with proper logging
        return
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete() # Consider moving this as per other comment
        parse_csv(content)
```

```python
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


Unhandled HTTP Errors: The `httpx.get` call can raise exceptions (e.g., `httpx.RequestError` for network issues, timeouts) or return non-200 status codes that are not handled. This could crash the task.

Suggestion: Wrap the `httpx.get` call in a try-except block to catch potential `httpx` exceptions and check the `response.status_code` more thoroughly before proceeding.
```python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=10.0) # Add timeout
    response.raise_for_status() # Raises HTTPStatusError for 4xx/5xx responses
except httpx.RequestError as exc:
    print(f"An error occurred while requesting {exc.request.url!r}.") # Replace with proper logging
    return None
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:
    print(f"Error response {exc.response.status_code} while requesting {exc.request.url!r}.") # Replace with proper logging
    return None

# response.status_code == 200 check is now less critical if raise_for_status() is used, but kept for clarity
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
return None # Handle cases where status is not 200 and not an error raised by raise_for_status

```

                (description := entry.get("description")),
                (image := entry["image"]),
            )
        ):
            if any((title, description, image)):
                return True
```


Complex Validation Logic: The logic inside `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` using nested `any()` calls and walrus operators is overly complex for checking if at least one record has some data. It can be simplified.

Suggestion:
```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    if not content: # Handle empty content early
        return False
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        # Check if any of the relevant fields have a non-empty value
        title = entry.get("title", "")
        description = entry.get("description", "")
        image_url = entry.get("image", "") # Use .get() for safety
        if title or description or image_url:
            return True
    return False
```

```python
    def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
```


Insufficient Test Coverage: The added test `test_load_images_command_executes_when_called` only checks if the management command runs without error by mocking the underlying `load_images` task completely. This test does not verify any part of the actual image loading logic (fetching, validation, error handling, deletion, parsing, saving). 

Suggestion: Add integration tests or more detailed unit tests for the `load_images` task itself. These tests should cover scenarios like:
- Successful loading from a valid CSV URL.
- Handling of invalid URLs or missing `SRC_FILE` env var.
- Handling of network errors during fetch.
- Handling of malformed CSV data.
- Correct deletion and replacement of existing data.
- Behavior with empty CSV files.

```python
        return "Done"
```


Incorrect Management Command Output: The `handle` method returns the string "Done". In Django management commands, return values are ignored. To provide output to the console, you should use `self.stdout.write()`.

Suggestion:
```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

from images.tasks import load_images


class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = (
        "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
        "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
    )

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        load_images() # Consider calling the task asynchronously: load_images.delay()
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Done"))

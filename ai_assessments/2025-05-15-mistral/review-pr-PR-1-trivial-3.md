ðŸ¦‰ **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

**Summary:**

The PR is a chore update, and the changes are related to configuration files. The changes are minor and do not affect the functionality of the code. The changes are related to updating the cruft commit hash and changing the pre-commit hook from "push" to "pre-push". There are no major issues, but I would like to see the changes in the pre-commit-config.yaml file tested to ensure that the pre-push hook works as expected.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Correctness]** ðŸŸ¡ `.cruft.json:3`




```json
"commit": "381fcbbe5e4048233208117a779a5ac8e26a6dba",
```


The commit hash has been updated. Please ensure that the new commit hash is valid and that the template is up to date.

> **Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

**Summary:**

The PR is of good quality, but there are some minor issues that need to be addressed. The changes made to the `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files are necessary for the project, but they should be documented in the PR description. Additionally, the commit message should be more descriptive.

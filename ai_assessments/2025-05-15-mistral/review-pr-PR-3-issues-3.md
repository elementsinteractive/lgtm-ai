游불 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks 游뱁

**Summary:**

The PR introduces a new scheduled task to process a CSV file and includes the necessary changes to the settings and tasks. The code is generally well-structured and follows best practices. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better correctness and readability. The author should address the correctness issues and consider reverting the `DATABASES` configuration to the multi-line format for better readability.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The `get_content` function does not handle the case where the URL is `None`. This could lead to a `ValidationError` being raised. Consider adding a check for `None` before validating the URL. ```python
if url is None:
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:39`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


The `get_content` function does not handle the case where the URL is invalid. This could lead to a `ValidationError` being raised. Consider adding a check for invalid URLs before making the HTTP request. ```python
if not url:
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:16`




```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
```


The `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function does not handle the case where the CSV content is empty. This could lead to a `csv.Error` being raised. Consider adding a check for empty content before parsing the CSV. ```python
if not content:
    return False
```

**Summary:**

The PR introduces Celery task scheduling to the Django application with the task being triggered by a crontab schedule. There's also a custom management command to load images, which is seemingly deprecated but still executed with a small test to confirm the command.

While the overall PR looks good, with structured and logical changes, there are some improvements and concerns that need addressing:

1. The test provided for the `load_images` management command is quite limited and only checks command execution, not its functionality.
2. Code structure could be slightly refined for better readability.
3. Potential issue with unhandled exceptions in HTTP requests.

Changes are required mainly in testing and handling possible errors gracefully.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:36`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


There is no exception handling for network issues or non-200 responses. If the request fails or receives a different response, it might cause unexpected behavior.

Consider adding exception handling for HTTP errors and conditional checks for response status codes.

```python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
except Exception as e:
    # Log the exception
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:48`




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


Make sure to check if 'content' is not None before passing it to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`, otherwise it might raise an error.

Add a simple check:

```python
if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    # proceed with processing
```

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8`




```python
call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


The test only verifies if the command runs, not if it functions correctly. Consider checking whether `load_images` gets called appropriately and possibly mock components to ensure CSV processing works as expected.

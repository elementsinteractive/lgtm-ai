**Summary:**

The PR modifies two configuration files: `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. In `.cruft.json`, a commit hash is updated which seems intentional to track a new state or version of the template. In the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, the pre-commit stages and hooks configurations have been adjusted. The default stage for some processes switched from "push" to "pre-push" and moved from "commit" to "pre-commit" for the "Format Code" hook, improving accuracy when stages are triggered, which appears to align better with anticipated workflow stages for pre-commit checks.

No correctness or major quality issues were found, and these changes align with typical work pipeline optimization practices. The changes are deliberate and contextually appropriate for integrating pre-commit hooks to optimize code checking workflows.

Overall, this PR looks solid and should improve the workflow with no significant issues.

**Specific Comments:**

- ü¶â **[Quality]** üîµ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:10`




```YAML
-          - "commit"
+          - "pre-commit"
```


The change from `"commit"` to `"pre-commit"` for the `"Format Code"` hook refines the hook to run checks earlier, likely catching issues sooner in the development process. This aligns hook execution with its name and intended purpose.

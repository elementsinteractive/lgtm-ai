**Summary:**

The PR makes minor changes to configuration files `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. In `.cruft.json`, the commit reference for the template has been updated. In `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, the default stages for hooks have been changed from 'push' to 'pre-push', and one of the hooks 'format-code' has had its stage updated from 'commit' to 'pre-commit'. 

The changes appear purposeful, likely aimed at refining the pre-commit checks setup to suit current project practices. However, since these involve configuration files, it's crucial that they align with the project's CI/CD requirements and team expectations. 

Overall, the quality of the PR seems good, with no apparent correctness or quality issues; therefore, no line comments are necessary. Hence, the PR scores as "LGTM."

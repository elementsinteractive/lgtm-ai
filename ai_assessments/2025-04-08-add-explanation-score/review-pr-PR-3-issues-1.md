**Summary:**

The PR introduces a new Django management command `load_images` and a corresponding Celery task to load images. The command and task seem well-structured; however, some issues need to be addressed to improve the robustness and reliability of the code.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/config/settings.py:167`




```Python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
            hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
```


Ensure that `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` and `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR` environment variables are properly set in the environment. If they might be unset, consider providing default values that make sense for your application.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:7`




```Python
help = (
    "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
    "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
)
```


The command help text mentions this feature is deprecated. If it's no longer needed, consider removing it to prevent confusion.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:20`




```Python
if any((title, description, image)):
```


The `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function uses an unnecessary second `any` check after the initial one for `title`, `description`, and `image`. Consider refactoring to avoid redundancy.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:42`




```Python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


If the URL is not valid or the HTTP request fails or returns a non-200 status code, `get_content` returns `None`. Ensure consumers of this function are handling `None` appropriately to avoid potential `TypeError`.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댯 `tests/images/test_commands.py:10`




```Python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
```


The test uses monkeypatch to set the `load_images` function, which is good to avoid side effects during testing. However, consider checking more conditions, such as what happens when the command cannot load images properly.

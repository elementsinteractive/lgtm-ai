**Summary:**

The PR introduces a Celery task for loading images and a management command to execute this task. A Celery beat schedule is also added to the Django settings to trigger the task automatically. However, a few issues need addressing before merging.

The overall structure is good but there are some improvements needed for better code quality and to ensure functionality is correct. The main issues are related to correctness and quality, especially with error handling, variable naming, and unnecessary code duplication.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The `url` variable is assigned to itself unnecessarily. You can remove the repetitive assignment to improve readability.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:45`




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


If `get_content` returns `None`, calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` will raise a `TypeError` since it expects a list. Consider adding a check for `None`.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:37`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


The `get_content` function should handle exceptions like connection errors when calling `httpx.get`. Without catching potential `httpx` exceptions, your function might silently fail, which could affect the entire flow.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:16`




```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
```


Function names should generally be descriptive of their actions. Consider renaming `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` to `has_valid_record_in_csv`. This improves readability and provides clarity on function intent.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:4`




```python
class TestLoadImagesCMD:
```


Consider adding more tests, especially for edge cases, such as when the CSV is empty or when invalid data is encountered. Also, test whether the task is correctly scheduled and if changes in schedules reflect as expected.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:40`




```python
if response.status_code == 200:
```


The `return None` statement is missing or implicit in the `get_content` function when `response.status_code` is not 200. Consider adding an explicit `return` for better clarity.

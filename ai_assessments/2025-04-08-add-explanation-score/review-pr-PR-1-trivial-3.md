**Summary:**

This PR makes minor updates to some configuration files related to project setup and pre-commit hooks. Specifically, it updates the commit reference in the '.cruft.json' file and changes hook stages in the '.pre-commit-config.yaml'. Overall, these changes appear to be straightforward, addressing configuration needs without altering any functional code logic. There are no correctness or functional issues evident in the changes since these are related mainly to configuration updates. However, there are some quality concerns regarding explicit YAML formatting for better readability and maintainability. The changes are quite simple and unlikely to introduce any unforeseen problems in the typical development environment, meaning no additional tests are required for these specific configuration updates.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:1`




```yaml
default_install_hook_types: [pre-push, pre-commit]
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
repos:
```


It's a good practice to include comments in YAML files to clarify the purpose of each section, especially for complex configurations. While this file isn't very complex, a brief comment about what each hook is meant to do might be helpful for future maintainers or collaborators.

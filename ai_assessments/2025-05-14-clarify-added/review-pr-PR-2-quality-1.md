**Summary:**

This PR is an excellent example of a clean and purposeful refactor. By extracting formatting logic (such as Markdown and terminal rendering) out of tightly coupled code in the main and GitLab client modules, and introducing well-defined formatter protocols, the codebase is now more modular, extensible, and maintainable. The separation of concerns is handled very well, and the new structure accommodates future extensibility (such as a potential GitHub integration) with ease.

Documentation for the base formatter protocol is good, as are the docstrings for the Markdown and Terminal implementations. However, to further improve developer experience, you might consider adding clearer examples (perhaps in the form of usage docstrings or comments) for those wanting to implement custom formatters, especially regarding expected input and output types.

Test coverage for both formatters and the client integration is robust and covers important usage scenarios. Naming, code clarity, and organization are all strong. There are no significant issues to address in terms of correctness, quality, testing, or security.

Overall, this is a highly maintainable and extensible refactoring PR. Well done!

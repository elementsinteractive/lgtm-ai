**Summary:**

This PR is a well-executed refactor that separates the formatting logic out of the GitLab client and the main application entrypoint, introducing reusable and extensible formatter classes (Markdown, terminal, etc.). The code leverages typing with Protocols and TypeVars for clear contracts and extensibility. All code and tests have been correctly updated, and comprehensive new unit tests validate the formatter logic, especially for Markdown output. The changes strongly improve maintainability, modularity, and pave the way for future platform integrations. No issues with correctness, security, or code quality were found, and the PR fully meets its stated goals.

No actions required. Excellent work!

**Summary:**

This PR updates configuration files: the .cruft.json commit hash is updated to track a new template version, and .pre-commit-config.yaml is amended to clarify hook stages with the addition of 'pre-push' and 'pre-commit'. These are standard, low-risk maintenance changes that do not impact code logic or raise issues of correctness, quality, security, or testing. The updates are appropriate and do not introduce any problems. The PR is ready to be merged.

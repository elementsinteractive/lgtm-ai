**Summary:**

This PR introduces a scheduled Celery task to process images from a CSV file, along with a Django management command and a basic integration test. The implementation is generally solid, but several issues need attention before merging:

- In the main task, if the 'SRC_FILE' environment variable is missing or 'get_content' returns None, subsequent logic will fail (potentially with a TypeError). Add defensive checks for missing/invalid environment variables and return values.
- The csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record function uses unnecessary assignment expressions that reduce readability and risks KeyErrors. Refactor for clarity and robust field access.
- In get_content, make the return None explicit in non-200 status code paths, and remove redundant assignments.

Test coverage is basic but acceptable given the mocked context. No major security concerns were noted. Once the above items are addressedâ€”especially around robustnessâ€”the PR will be in good shape for merging.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Correctness]** ðŸ”´ `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


If os.environ.get("SRC_FILE") returns None, get_content(None) will attempt to validate and fetch a None URL, which will likely cause an exception or fail validation. Add an explicit check for None before calling get_content. Also, csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content) will raise an error if content is None. Defensive programming here is necessary.

Suggestion:
src_file = os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")
if not src_file:
    # handle missing SRC_FILE case (e.g., raise exception or log error)
    return
content = get_content(src_file)
if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)

```python
if any(
    (
        (title := entry.get("title")),
        (description := entry.get("description")),
        (image := entry["image"]),
    )
):
    if any((title, description, image)):
        return True
```


The use of assignment expressions (walrus operators) and direct access to entry["image"] inside tuples for any() is unnecessarily complex and risks KeyError if 'image' is missing. Refactor for clarity and to avoid possible exceptions:

for entry in reader:
    title = entry.get("title")
    description = entry.get("description")
    image = entry.get("image")
    if any([title, description, image]):
        return True
return False

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `src/images/tasks.py:41`




```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


In get_content, if the HTTP response is not status 200, no value is returned. Make this explicit by adding a 'return None' in the function's final branch.

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
def get_content(url: str | None) -> list[str] | None:
    url = url
```


The line 'url = url' inside get_content does nothing and can be safely removed for clarity.

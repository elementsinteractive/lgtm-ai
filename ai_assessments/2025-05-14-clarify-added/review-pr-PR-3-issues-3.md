**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Celery scheduled task and Django management command to process image loading from a remote CSV file, and includes accompanying tests. The structure is logical, with task separation and service extraction, and initial testing is supplied. There are, however, some important issues that should be addressed before merging:

1. Correctness: Error handling in the pipeline needs improvement. If fetching content fails or returns None, downstream calls will crash; add checks and robust error handling for network and CSV parsing failures. Some code in validation is overly complex and fragile (e.g., assignments within tuples and unsafe key access for 'image'). Also, deleting all images before loading new ones is risky if loading failsâ€”consider a safer transactional or partial-update approach.
2. Quality: The management command is marked as deprecated in its help text but remains tested and availableâ€”this could confuse maintainers. Environment variable naming in scheduling is inconsistent; this should be standardized for clarity.

Recommended actions: improve error handling, refactor the CSV validation function for clarity and safety, clarify deprecation status/documentation, and standardize env variable names.

Addressing these issues will ensure the reliability and maintainability of the scheduled image processing.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Correctness]** ðŸ”´ `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
```


If get_content returns None (e.g., due to network error or invalid URL), calling csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content) will raise a TypeError. Add an explicit check before proceeding with CSV processing:

```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if content is None:
    # log or handle error
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```

```python
            if any(
                (
                    (title := entry.get("title")),
                    (description := entry.get("description")),
                    (image := entry["image"]),
                )
            ):
```


This use of assignment expressions (':=') and tuple inside 'any' adds unnecessary complexity and can cause a KeyError if 'image' is missing. Refactor for clarity and safety:

```python
title = entry.get('title')
description = entry.get('description')
image = entry.get('image')
if any([title, description, image]):
    return True
```

Also, clarify exactly what constitutes a "valid" record if you intend to change this logic.

```python
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


If httpx.get raises a network error, it will cause the Celery task to fail. Add robust exception handling for network calls:

```python
try:
    response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
except httpx.RequestError:
    return None
```

Also, consider logging or commenting when returning None due to a failed fetch or non-200 status code to aid debugging.

```python
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
```


Deleting all existing images before loading new ones can result in a temporary state where all images are gone if parsing or processing fails after deletion. Consider a safer update approach, such as transactional operations or only deleting after confirming new images will be loaded successfully.

```python
    help = (
        "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
        "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
    )
```


The help string mentions deprecation but the command remains tested and available without warning. Either update the help string to remove the deprecation note if this is in use, or add warning/clarification logic if it truly is deprecated to avoid confusion for maintainers.

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `src/config/settings.py:171`




```python
            minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
            hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
```


Environment variable names for scheduling (minute/hour) are inconsistent. Standardizing to, for example, 'CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE' and 'CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR' will improve clarity and reduce configuration errors.

**Summary:**

This PR makes small modifications to configuration files: updating a commit hash in .cruft.json and adjusting pre-commit hook stages in .pre-commit-config.yaml. No correctness or security issues are present. However, the clarity and maintainability of the pre-commit configuration could be improved by providing comments to justify the specific stages being used, which would benefit future developers.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:33`




```yaml
stages:
- "pre-commit"
```


Consider adding a comment to explain why the pre-commit stage is specifically required here. This can enhance the readability and maintainability of the configuration for future developers who may not immediately understand the reasoning behind this choice.

**Summary:**

The PR introduces new tasks and management commands for image loading using Django and Celery. While the code is generally clear and logically structured, it contains some areas for improvement in terms of code quality and readability. 

1. **Quality Issues:** 
   - `settings.py`: The `DATABASES` dictionary has been refactored into a single line. While functionally correct, this can hinder readability and should possibly be reverted to the previous multiline format for better maintainability.
   - `load_images.py`: The return value of `load_images()` should be checked for success, even if the current function does not return specific error codes.
   - `tasks.py`: The line "`url = url`" is unnecessary and should be removed to improve code clarity.

Overall, the issues are relatively minor, primarily affecting quality rather than correctness or security. The PR is close to being ready but needs slight adjustments before merging.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:13`




```python
load_images()
```


Consider storing the return value of `load_images()` and verifying its success or failure, even if the function currently does not return any specific error or success codes.

```python
result = load_images()
# Check result for logging or changes in execution.
```

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/config/settings.py:95`




```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


The refactored DATABASES dictionary should be realigned to maintain consistency and readability. Consider reverting to the previous multiline format.

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": env.dj_db_url(
        "DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60)
    )
}
```

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The assignment `url = url` doesn't serve any purpose and can be removed to improve code clarity.

**Summary:**

This PR involves minor changes primarily in configuration files, updating the `.cruft.json` file to reference a new commit and modifying the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. These changes update the pre-commit hooks to use 'pre-push' and 'pre-commit', which adhere to standard pre-commit configurations. While these changes are minor, they could affect the triggering of hooks in automated CI/CD systems, so it's crucial to ensure that they align with the project's workflow. Overall, the changes are well-aligned with standard practices, but the effects of the configuration alterations should be verified in the context of your team's specific workflow.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3`




```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
```


The change from 'push' to 'pre-push' in the default stages may affect when the hooks are triggered. If these hooks are critical to your deployment process, ensure that they are correctly triggered at the new designated point. If previously relying on 'push', verify all edge cases to ensure continuity in hook execution.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:33`




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


The update from 'commit' to 'pre-commit' in the format-code hook stages ensures that code formatting checks occur before committing. Confirm this aligns with your team's workflow expectations and communicate this update to prevent unexpected pre-commit failures.

> **Score:** Needs Work 游댢

**Summary:**

The PR introduces key enhancements such as a Celery beat schedule, a Django management command for loading images, and tasks to process images from a CSV file. The overall code structure is solid, but there are critical corrections required for error handling and data validation, particularly in network requests and CSV processing. Additionally, testing needs to be improved to ensure database state changes correctly after command execution. Some minor quality improvements, such as code redundancy and return path clarifications, are also necessary.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:39`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


It's important to handle potential exceptions that might be raised during HTTP requests (e.g., network errors). Consider adding a `try-except` block around the `httpx.get` call to handle such cases gracefully.

```python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text.splitlines(True)
except httpx.RequestError as e:
    # Handle network error
    print(f"An error occurred while requesting {url}: {e}")
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
```


Please provide validation for the case when `content` is `None` to avoid passing `None` to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` method, which could cause issues. Consider adding a check before proceeding with CSV processing.

```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if content is None:
    print("Failed to retrieve content.")
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:17`




```python
assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


While the test checks for command execution, it's beneficial to test more aspects, such as whether the images were actually processed as expected. Consider adding tests to verify that the database state changes as intended after the command execution. This ensures the command performs its task effectively and allows detection of integration issues.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The variable assignment is redundant. You can directly use `url` in the URL validation line without re-assigning it.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:42`




```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
# Make it explicit
return None
```


The return type in the function signature specifies it can return a list or None, but there is a path where the function could implicitly return `None`. Make this explicit to ensure clarity in return types, which helps in maintaining the code and understanding function behavior.

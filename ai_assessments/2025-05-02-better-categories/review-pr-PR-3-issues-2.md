**Summary:**

This PR builds on Django and Celery to set up a `load_images` task with associated management command and test. Several key areas need adjustments: 

1. The `DATABASES` variable is initialized twice in the `settings.py`, which should be corrected to avoid misconfiguration. 
2. None safety checks are missing before invoking `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`, which expects a list. 
3. Security can be reinforced by handling potential request hangs with timeouts in the `httpx.get` function.

Overall, these issues must be addressed before merging, but the PR demonstrates a solid understanding of Django and Celery.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/config/settings.py:95`




```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


The `DATABASES` setting is initialized twice, which can cause misconfiguration. Ensure there is only one initialization.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


Ensure `content` is a list before passing it to the `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function to avoid errors.

- 游불 **[Security]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:39`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
```


Add a timeout to `httpx.get` to avoid hanging the request if it fails or takes too long.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:14`




```python
return "Done"
```


Django management commands should return `None` by default. Remove the return statement to conform to this standard.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The line `url = url` is redundant and can be removed to improve code quality.

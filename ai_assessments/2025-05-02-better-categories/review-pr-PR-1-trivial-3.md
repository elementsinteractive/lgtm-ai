🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

This PR updates the `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration files. The `.cruft.json` update involves a commit hash change, while the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` updates the hook types and stages for pre-commit hooks. The changes are simple, focusing primarily on configuration and do not affect any functional code. While the updates are straightforward, it would be beneficial to include comments in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file explaining the reasons for changing from `push` to `pre-push` and from `commit` to `pre-commit` in the hook stages. This will enhance understanding and maintainability for other developers reviewing this configuration in the future. Overall, there are only minor quality issues that need attention, making this PR almost ready for merge. However, these are not critical and can be adjusted easily.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3`




```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
```


Consider adding a comment explaining the reasoning behind the changes in the stages from `push` to `pre-push` and `commit` to `pre-commit`. This will provide clarity to those reviewing or maintaining the code later.

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:33`




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


Consider explaining the reasons behind any changes made to hooks and stages to give context to future maintainers. This documentation can help clarify the adjustments.

## Summary

> The code introduces a notable refactor improving batch processing and importer functionality for images in a Django application. New serializers, services, and migration adjustments enhance maintainability and performance characterization. However, some details related to testing, variable naming, and method structure should be refined to improve clarity and consistency. Overall, several tests are added, but some logic might require more granular test cases.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:31: It's unclear why the image field is set to be non-blank given the previous version allowed it to be blank. This change may have implications for how the API handles image uploads with no image URL.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:4: Consider adding a docstring to explain the purpose of this file and the main classes/functions it contains. This will aid future maintainers.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:64: The error handling during the retry in `save_with_retry_on_errors` seems minimal. It would help to log errors encountered while saving the batch.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:7: Consider renaming `importer` to something more descriptive, like 'batch_importer', to clarify its functionality.

- Comment: src/images/services/resources.py:57: Ensure that the resource files are cleaned up properly after their use, including cases where exceptions may be raised during processing.

- Comment: tests/images/test_serializers.py:12: The tests for the serializers should also check for other edge cases, such as inputs that are too long, or invalid URL formats.

# Review for PR: PR-2

> Sample 2

## Summary

> The code introduces logging to various components, which is a good practice for observability and debugging. However, there are a few areas of improvement regarding consistency, code quality, and testing coverage. We need to ensure that all critical paths are logged and that exception handling is consistent throughout the codebase. There are also some missing imports in the tests due to unneeded imports from previous structures, which could be cleaned up. Additionally, the verbosity levels for logging should have a more explicit design to enhance clarity. Though some tests were added for logging functionality, ensure tests cover other functionalities as well.

**Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

### Comments:

- Comment: src/lgtm/__main__.py:24: Consider setting the logger's level based on the verbose flag when defining the logger instead of later in the `review` function, to keep configuration centralized.

- Comment: src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py:13: Make sure to implement some additional error handling or a retry mechanism in case of transient errors while communicating with GitLab.

- Comment: src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py:110: Comments indicating potential retries of posting should include more context or mechanisms to avoid losing information about where the retry occurred.

- Comment: tests/test_main.py:7: While testing logging level adjustment, ensure that the test includes verification of logger outputs to capture complete logging functionality.

- Comment: pyproject.toml:0: It's good to see attention to tryceratops noise, but ensure any critical exceptions meant for logging are properly documented within logging practices.

## Summary

> The code changes mostly improve the functionality of the image handling portion of the application, adding the ability to bulk create images and implement batch processing for image imports. There seems to be good use of serializers and migration handling. However, there are some issues related to the code quality, consistency, and lack of adequate test coverage for some new features. Required changes include fixing the migration dependencies, ensuring test coverage for edge cases, particularly in the importer functions, and debugging areas where the error handling should be improved. Also, code quality improvements can be made, particularly in the service and serializer definitions for better maintainability and clarity.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/config/settings.py:7: Consider adding a comment explaining "BULK_CREATE_LIST_SERIALIZER_BATCH_SIZE", especially if it's a significant part of your application configuration.

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:26: It's unclear why the field 'image_id' has a unique constraint and a default of 0. Consider whether this is the intended design, as it may lead to issues if multiple records have the same default value.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:10: In 'start()', consider explicitly logging when batches are processed to help with debugging or monitoring during runtime, as it can be hard to follow the batch process otherwise.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:9: In 'importer', consider introducing better error handling or logging to deal with potential HTTP errors when pulling data from a URI, as the current implementation may fail silently.

- Comment: src/images/services/resources.py:45: The use of `while not row:` might cause an infinite loop if the data is malformed. Consider adding a safeguard to deal with such cases gracefully.

- Comment: src/images/services/resources.py:54: Error checking after the URI validation using URLValidator could also be improved, allowing for clearer feedback when a bad URI is provided.

- Comment: tests/images/test_serializers.py:20: Additional tests for edge cases with 'normalize_title' and 'normalize_description' methods are needed to verify proper sanitization of these fields, entering invalid or unexpected input cases.

- Comment: tests/images/test_tasks.py:15: Ensure batch size for the tests actually reflects the realities of the application's expected load; consider testing with maximum expected input sizes and various batch sizes to confirm robustness.

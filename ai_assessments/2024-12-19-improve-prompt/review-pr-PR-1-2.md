## Summary

> The overall quality of the code is good, with new features implemented for batching and importing images. The code is clean and well-structured. However, there are a few notable improvements needed, including better error handling, tests for edge cases, and possibly refining some method signatures.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:24: Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the new 'image_id' field and its default value, which aids in maintaining the code in the future.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:30: In the `save_with_retry_on_errors` method, it's better to log the errors encountered rather than simply discarding the invalid items. This will help in debugging.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:32: It would be beneficial to validate the input URI before processing it in the importer function to prevent errors from being raised later on.

- Comment: tests/images/test_tasks.py:84: The test suite could include more scenarios where input data might be malformed or invalid, ensuring full coverage of edge cases.

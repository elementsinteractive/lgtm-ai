**Summary:**

The PR introduces a scheduled Celery task to process a CSV file and update Image models, along with a management command. However, there are critical issues regarding data integrity (non-atomic delete and load), error handling (potential crashes during CSV parsing and content fetching), and insufficient testing of the core logic. The management command's help text is also confusing.

Required changes:
- Implement transactional behavior for image deletion and creation to prevent data loss.
- Add robust error handling for CSV parsing (e.g., missing keys) and content fetching (e.g., network issues, invalid URLs leading to None content).
- Significantly improve test coverage with unit tests for the Celery task, CSV parsing, and content fetching logic, including edge cases.
- Clarify the purpose and status of the `load_images` management command in its help text.
- Address minor code quality issues like inconsistent environment variable naming and dead code.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:18`




```python
for entry in reader:
    if any(
        (
            (title := entry.get("title")),
            (description := entry.get("description")),
            (image := entry["image"]),
        )
    ):
        if any((title, description, image)):
            return True
```


Accessing `entry["image"]` directly will raise a `KeyError` if the "image" column is missing in a CSV row or if a row is malformed. It's safer to use `entry.get("image")` to avoid unhandled exceptions.

Additionally, the outer `if any(...)` construct, which wraps walrus operator assignments within a tuple, is unconventional and its intent is unclear. The tuple `((title := ...), (description := ...), (image := ...))` will likely always evaluate to `True` if it contains elements, regardless of the values assigned. The effective check for truthiness of the values happens in the inner `if any((title, description, image)):`.

Consider simplifying and securing this logic, for example:
```python
for entry in reader:
    title = entry.get("title")
    description = entry.get("description")
    image_url = entry.get("image")  # Use .get() for all potentially missing keys

    if title or description or image_url: # Checks if any of the fields have a truthy value
        return True
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


If `get_content` returns `None` (e.g., due to an invalid URL, network issue, or non-200 response), `content` will be `None`. Subsequently, calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(None)` will cause `csv.DictReader(None)` to raise a `TypeError` because it expects an iterator. 

You should add a check to ensure `content` is not `None` before passing it to `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.
Example:
```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if content is not None and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
else:
    # Handle the case where content is None, e.g., log a warning or error
    logger.warning("Could not retrieve CSV content or CSV is invalid.")
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:48`




```python
Image.objects.all().delete()
parse_csv(content)
```


Deleting all `Image` objects with `Image.objects.all().delete()` before attempting to parse and load new data from `parse_csv(content)` is a high-risk operation. If `parse_csv(content)` fails for any reason (e.g., malformed data within the CSV, issues during individual object creation, database errors), the system will be left with no image data at all. This operation needs to be atomic to ensure data integrity.

Consider wrapping the deletion and the import process within a database transaction using `django.db.transaction.atomic`:
```python
from django.db import transaction
# ...
# (after content validation)
# if content is not None and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            Image.objects.all().delete()
            parse_csv(content) # Ensure parse_csv is also robust or its operations are part of this transaction
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error. Depending on the desired behavior, you might leave the old data intact.
        logger.error(f"Failed to load images atomically: {e}")
```
This ensures that if `parse_csv` fails, the initial deletion will be rolled back, preserving the existing data.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:7`




```python
help = (
    "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
    "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
)
```


The help text states this command is "Deprecated". If this command is part of the new scheduled task feature (e.g., for manual triggering or initial setup), this message is confusing and potentially misleading. Please clarify the role of this command in relation to the new scheduled task and update the help text to accurately reflect its current functionality and purpose.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8`




```python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "images.management.commands.load_images.load_images",
        lambda *args, **kwargs: None,
    )
    out = StringIO()

    call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

    assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


This test verifies that the `load_images` management command can be invoked and returns "Done", but it does so by monkeypatching the core `images.tasks.load_images` function to a no-op lambda. This means the actual functionality of fetching, parsing the CSV, and interacting with the database is not being tested here.

To ensure the reliability of this feature, you should add:
1.  **Unit tests for `images.tasks.csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`**: Test with various CSV inputs (valid, invalid, empty, missing columns).
2.  **Unit tests for `images.tasks.get_content`**: Mock `httpx.get` to simulate different scenarios like successful responses, network errors, various HTTP status codes, and invalid URLs.
3.  **Integration-style tests for the `images.tasks.load_images` Celery task**: These tests should cover the end-to-end logic of the task. Use `pytest-django` for database interaction, mock `os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")` and `httpx.get` to supply controlled test CSV data (e.g., via a string or a temporary file). Verify that database records are correctly created/deleted and that errors are handled gracefully (e.g., transactional behavior).

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:45`




```python
@shared_task
def load_images() -> None:
```


The core logic within the `load_images` task and its helper functions (`get_content`, `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`) is not covered by unit tests. 

It is crucial to add unit tests to verify:
- Correct parsing of CSV data, including handling of valid entries, malformed rows, and missing columns (especially the 'image' key).
- Proper behavior of `get_content` when fetching the CSV from a URL, including successful fetching, handling of network errors, different HTTP status codes, and invalid or unreachable URLs.
- Correct database operations within `load_images`, particularly the deletion of existing records and the creation of new `Image` instances based on CSV data. This should also test the transactional behavior if implemented.
- Behavior with edge cases such as empty CSV files, files with no valid records, or if `get_content` returns `None`.

Comprehensive unit tests for these components are essential for ensuring the robustness and correctness of this scheduled task.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


This line `url = url` is a no-op (it assigns the variable to itself) and can be removed. Consider deleting it.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/config/settings.py:171`




```python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
```


The environment variable names used for configuring the Celery beat schedule, `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` and `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR`, are inconsistent in their naming convention. One includes a "CELERY_" prefix, while the other does not. 

For better maintainability and clarity, it's recommended to use a consistent naming pattern for related environment variables. For example, you could use `CELERY_LOAD_IMAGES_MINUTE` and `CELERY_LOAD_IMAGES_HOUR` or `LOAD_IMAGES_CRON_MINUTE` and `LOAD_IMAGES_CRON_HOUR`.

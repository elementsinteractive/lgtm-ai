ðŸ¦‰ **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a significant improvement by refactoring formatter logic out of the client and main scripts, enhancing modularity and maintainability. The new formatter structure using a base protocol and specific implementations (Markdown, Terminal) is well-designed and clearly implemented. Good job on adding tests for the new `MarkDownFormatter` and updating existing tests to reflect these changes.

There are a couple of minor points to address:
1.  A file (`tests/test_git_client/__init__.py`) appears to have been incorrectly moved/renamed to `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py`. Please verify this and ensure `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` is correctly a new file.
2.  A minor docstring improvement is suggested for clarity in `src/lgtm/formatters/base.py`.

Addressing these small issues will make this PR ready for merging. Overall, excellent work!

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py:1`

The file `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` is currently tracked as a rename of `tests/test_git_client/__init__.py`. This seems incorrect, as an `__init__.py` from a test utility package should generally not be repurposed for a source package like `lgtm.formatters`.
It's recommended that `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` be a new, independent file (even if empty). The old `tests/test_git_client/__init__.py` should likely have been deleted or moved to the new test directory structure if appropriate (e.g., to `tests/git_client/__init__.py` if it wasn't created as new).
Please adjust the file history/state to reflect `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` as a new addition.

```python
            comments: The comments that were generated during the review and need to be displayed in the general summary section.
```


The docstring for the `comments` parameter is a bit prescriptive.

Consider making it slightly more flexible, as a formatter might choose to handle these comments differently (e.g., not in the summary, as seen with `TerminalFormatter` which logs a warning).

Suggested change for the docstring of the `comments` parameter:
```diff
-            comments: The comments that were generated during the review and need to be displayed in the general summary section.
+            comments: Optional list of review comments. Implementers can use these to display comments within or alongside the summary section, if applicable for the specific format.
```

ðŸ¦‰ **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

**Summary:**

This PR effectively refactors the formatting logic into a dedicated `formatters` module, significantly improving modularity and extensibility. The introduction of the `ReviewFormatter` protocol and its concrete implementations for Markdown and terminal output is well-executed. New tests for the `MarkDownFormatter` have been added, and existing tests were updated accordingly.

Overall, this is a quality refactor. There's a minor opportunity to reduce code duplication in the GitLab client tests and a suggestion to enhance test coverage for one of the new formatter methods.

```python
    def test_format_summary_section(self) -> None:
        review = Review(
            review_response=ReviewResponse(
                score="LGTM",
                summary="summary",
            ),
            pr_diff=mock.Mock(),
        )

        assert (
            self.formatter.format_summary_section(review)
            == "\n	Ã¤f\x89 **lgtm Review**\n\n> **Score:** LGTM 	d8	cd\n\n**Summary:**\n\nsummary"
        )
```


The test `test_format_summary_section` currently only covers the scenario where the `comments` argument to `format_summary_section` is `None` (its default). 

However, `MarkDownFormatter.format_summary_section` is designed to include formatted comments if a list of comments is explicitly passed to it (e.g., as done in `scripts/evaluate_review_quality.py`).

Consider adding a test case for `format_summary_section` where a non-empty list of `ReviewComment` is passed as the `comments` argument to ensure the concatenation of the summary and the formatted comments section works as expected.

**Suggestion:**

```python
    def test_format_summary_section_with_comments(self) -> None:
        review_comment = ReviewComment(
            comment="comment 1",
            category="Correctness",
            severity="LOW",
            old_path="old_path",
            new_path="new_path",
            line_number=1,
            is_comment_on_new_path=True,
        )
        review = Review(
            review_response=ReviewResponse(
                score="LGTM",
                summary="summary",
                comments=[review_comment]
            ),
            pr_diff=mock.Mock(),
        )
        comments_list = review.review_response.comments
        
        # Expected output construction based on MarkDownFormatter logic
        formatted_comments_section = self.formatter.format_comments_section(comments_list)
        expected_output = (
            "\n	Ã¤f\x89 **lgtm Review**\n\n"
            "> **Score:** LGTM 	d8	cd\n\n"
            "**Summary:**\n\n"
            "summary"
            f"\n\n{formatted_comments_section}"
        )

        assert self.formatter.format_summary_section(review, comments_list) == expected_output
```

```python
    fake_review = Review(
        PRDiff(1, ""),
        ReviewResponse(
            summary="a",
            score="LGTM",
            comments=[
                ReviewComment(
                    new_path="foo",
                    old_path="foo",
                    line_number=1,
                    comment="b",
                    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
                    category="Correctness",
                    severity="LOW",
                ),
                ReviewComment(
                    new_path="bar",
                    old_path="bar",
                    line_number=2,
                    comment="c",
                    is_comment_on_new_path=False,
                    category="Correctness",
                    severity="LOW",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    )
```


The `fake_review` object, or a very similar structure, is instantiated multiple times across different test methods (e.g., here in `test_post_review_successful` and later in `test_post_review_with_a_successful_and_an_unsuccessful_comments`). 

To improve maintainability and reduce redundancy, consider extracting this common test data setup into a pytest fixture or a helper method.

**Suggestion:**

```python
import pytest
from lgtm.ai.schemas import PRDiff, Review, ReviewComment, ReviewResponse # Add other necessary imports

@pytest.fixture
def fake_review_fixture() -> Review:
    return Review(
        PRDiff(1, ""),
        ReviewResponse(
            summary="a",
            score="LGTM",
            comments=[
                ReviewComment(
                    new_path="foo",
                    old_path="foo",
                    line_number=1,
                    comment="b",
                    is_comment_on_new_path=True,
                    category="Correctness",
                    severity="LOW",
                ),
                ReviewComment(
                    new_path="bar",
                    old_path="bar",
                    line_number=2,
                    comment="c",
                    is_comment_on_new_path=False,
                    category="Correctness",
                    severity="LOW",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    )

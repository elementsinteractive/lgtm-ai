**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Celery task scheduled to load images from a CSV file, along with a management command to trigger this process. While the feature is valuable, several critical issues must be addressed before it can be merged.

Key areas for improvement include:
1.  **Critical Data Loss Prevention**: The current logic deletes all existing images *before* processing the new CSV file. If parsing or data insertion fails, this will lead to complete data loss. This operation needs to be atomic (e.g., within a database transaction) or restructured to ensure new data is successfully prepared before old data is removed.
2.  **Error Handling and Robustness**: The code has several points where it can crash. Specifically, direct dictionary access (`entry["image"]`) in the CSV parsing logic can cause `KeyError`, and passing `None` (e.g., from a failed URL fetch) to `csv.DictReader` will result in a `TypeError`. These need to be handled gracefully.
3.  **Testing Coverage**: The core logic in `images.tasks.py` (fetching, parsing, database operations) lacks unit tests. Comprehensive tests are essential to ensure the reliability and correctness of this functionality.
4.  **Clarity and Code Quality**: The help text for the new management command is misleadingly marked as "Deprecated". Additionally, there are minor quality issues like redundant code, inconsistent environment variable naming, and potentially too permissive CSV validation logic that should be reviewed.

The PR cannot be merged in its current state. The most critical aspects to address are the data loss vulnerability and the unhandled errors. Comprehensive testing is also a high priority.

**Specific Comments:**

```python
        if any(
            (
                (title := entry.get("title")),
                (description := entry.get("description")),
                (image := entry["image"]),
            )
        ):
            if any((title, description, image)):
                return True
```


Using `entry["image"]` will raise a `KeyError` if the "image" column is missing in any row of the CSV, crashing the task. You should use `entry.get("image")` for safe access. Additionally, the nested `if any(...)` structure in `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` is redundant. If the outer `any(...)` (which uses walrus operators to assign variables) evaluates to true, it means at least one of `title`, `description`, or `image` was truthy and assigned. The inner `if any((title, description, image)):` is therefore always true if the outer condition is met.
Consider simplifying and making it safer like this:
```python
# In csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record function:
reader = csv.DictReader(content)
for entry in reader:
    title = entry.get("title")
    description = entry.get("description")
    image_url = entry.get("image") # Use .get() for safety here as well
    if any((title, description, image_url)):
        return True
return False
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
    if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


If `get_content` returns `None` (e.g., due to an invalid URL or network issue), `content` will be `None`. Passing `None` to `csv.DictReader` (used inside `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`) will raise a `TypeError` because it expects an iterable. This will crash the task. You need to handle the case where `content` is `None` before calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.
Example:
```python
# In load_images task
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if content is None:
    # Log this situation or raise an error, then return
    print("Failed to get content, content is None.") # Or use proper logging
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    # ... rest of the logic
```

```python
        Image.objects.all().delete()
```


Deleting all `Image` objects before parsing and attempting to save new ones is a critical risk. If `parse_csv(content)` fails for any reason (e.g., malformed CSV data not caught by `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`, database errors during object creation), all existing image data will be lost, and no new data will be loaded.
This operation should be performed within a database transaction. Alternatively, consider a safer update strategy: parse the CSV into a temporary structure, validate it, and then update/replace the database records in a more controlled manner, possibly by deleting old records only after new ones are successfully prepared or created.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:9`




```python
        "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
```


The help text describes this new command as "Deprecated". This is confusing as it's being introduced as part of a new feature. Please clarify or update the help text to accurately reflect its purpose and status. For example, you could remove the "Deprecated" line if it's not truly deprecated, or rephrase it to explain its relationship with migrations if relevant, without calling the command itself deprecated.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:45`




```python
@shared_task
def load_images() -> None:
```


This task `load_images` and its helper functions (`get_content`, `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`) contain significant logic (network requests, file parsing, conditional data deletion). However, there are no unit tests for this critical functionality in the PR. Please add tests to cover:
- Successful fetching and parsing of a valid CSV.
- Handling of invalid or unreachable URLs by `get_content`.
- Behavior of `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` with empty CSVs, CSVs with only invalid records, and CSVs with valid records.
- Correct database operations (deletion and creation/update of images), potentially using mocking for `Image.objects` and `parse_csv`.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:35`




```python
    try:
        validate(url)
    except ValidationError:
```


In `get_content`, while `validate(None)` (if `url` is `None`) would be caught by the `except ValidationError:`, it is clearer and more robust to explicitly check if `url` is `None` at the beginning of the function and return `None` early. This avoids unnecessary validator processing for an obviously invalid input.
```python
# Suggestion for the beginning of get_content:
if url is None:
    return None
```

```python
            minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
            hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
```


The environment variable names for configuring the Celery beat schedule are a bit inconsistent. `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` does not have the `CELERY_` prefix, while `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR` does. Consider standardizing them for clarity and easier discoverability, e.g., `CELERY_LOAD_IMAGES_MINUTE` and `CELERY_LOAD_IMAGES_HOUR`.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:26`




```python
            if any((title, description, image)):
```


In `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`, a record is considered to have valid data if *any* of title, description, or image URL is present (after the walrus assignment). This might be too permissive depending on the actual requirements. For instance, an entry without an image URL might not be useful even if it has a title. Consider if there are specific mandatory fields (e.g., the image URL itself) for a record to be truly 'valid' and worth processing.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
    url = url
```


This line `url = url` in the `get_content` function is a no-op (it assigns the variable to itself) and can be removed for cleaner code.
```python
# Suggestion:
# Remove the line:
# url = url
```

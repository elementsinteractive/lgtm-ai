🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

This PR updates the cruft commit hash in `.cruft.json` and standardizes pre-commit hook stages in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (e.g., `push` to `pre-push`, `commit` to `pre-commit`). These configuration changes are minor, appear correct, and improve consistency. No issues were found.

### 🔍 Summary

This PR is small and focused on updating the cruft pin and pre-commit configuration. The cruft commit update is straightforward. The main issue is in .pre-commit-config.yaml: hook types were used where pre-commit expects stage names. Specifically, default_stages should use stage names like commit or push (not pre-commit/pre-push), and individual hook stages should also use stage names. As written, those entries will be ignored and the hooks will not run at the intended times. Once these are corrected, the PR should be good to go.

**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
```


default_stages must use pre-commit stage names (e.g., commit, push). "pre-push" is a hook type, not a stage, and will be ignored — hooks won’t run on push as intended.

Replace with:

```
default_stages:
  - "push"
```

Note: default_install_hook_types (if configured) is separate and can include [pre-commit, pre-push]; that controls which git hooks are installed, not the stages at which hooks run.



- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


Hook stages must use pre-commit stage names. "pre-commit" here is a hook type and will be ignored; the hook won’t run on commit as intended.

Replace with:

```
stages:
  - commit
```

(If you also want the hook to run on push, add `- push`.)

### 🔍 Summary

This PR updates the cruft template pin and adjusts the pre-commit configuration. The .cruft.json change is straightforward and fine. However, the pre-commit config introduces two stage name misconfigurations that will prevent hooks from running: default_stages was changed to use "pre-push" and one hook’s stages was changed to "pre-commit". In pre-commit, stages/default_stages must use stage names (e.g., "commit", "push"), not hook types (e.g., "pre-commit", "pre-push"). Please revert these to valid stage names.

**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-push"
```


default_stages must list stage names (e.g., "push"), not hook types (e.g., "pre-push"). As written, hooks won’t trigger at push time.

Suggested fix:

```yaml
default_stages:
  - "push"
```



- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


The stages field must use pre-commit stage names (e.g., "commit"), not hook types (e.g., "pre-commit"). Otherwise this hook won’t run at commit time.

Suggested fix:

```yaml
stages:
  - "commit"
```

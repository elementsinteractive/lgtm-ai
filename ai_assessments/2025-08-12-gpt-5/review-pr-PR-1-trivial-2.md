### 🔍 Summary

Small, config-only PR. The cruft commit bump looks fine. In .pre-commit-config.yaml there’s a critical misconfiguration: a hook lists the stage as "pre-commit" which is not a valid stage name (the correct stage is "commit"). This will prevent the hook from running at commit time. Apart from that modified line, nothing else in the diff raises issues.

**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 🎯 Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```yaml
-   id: format-code
    name: Format Code
    entry: "just format"
    language: system
    files: .*\.py$
    stages:
      - "pre-commit"
```


The stage name should be "commit" (not "pre-commit"). pre-commit’s valid stage names include: commit, push, merge-commit, prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg, manual. Using "pre-commit" will prevent the hook from running.

Suggested fix:

```yaml
stages:
  - "commit"
```

## 🦉 lgtm Review

> **Score:** Needs Work 🔧

### 🔍 Summary

The PR introduces a well-designed refactoring by extracting formatting logic into a new `formatters` module, improving modularity and reusability. The use of a `ReviewFormatter` Protocol ensures extensibility, and the new Markdown and Terminal formatters are cleanly implemented, centralizing emoji constants. Adequate tests for the new markdown formatter have been added, and existing tests updated to align with the new formatter interface.

However, a significant issue was identified regarding an incorrect file rename. The file `tests/test_git_client/__init__.py` was incorrectly renamed to `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py`. This is semantically incorrect; a test `__init__.py` file should not become a production source file. The `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` should be a newly created file. This requires correction before merging. Additionally, a minor quality improvement can be made regarding a log message in the `TerminalFormatter`.

**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 ✅ Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴

The diff indicates that `tests/test_git_client/__init__.py` was renamed to `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py`. This is semantically incorrect and likely an artifact of an incorrect refactoring approach. A test `__init__.py` file should not be renamed and moved into a production source package. The `src/lgtm/formatters/__init__.py` file should be a newly created, separate file for the `formatters` package, and the original test `__init__.py` (if still needed) should remain or be explicitly deleted as a separate operation. Please correct this file history.

```python
        logger.warning("Comments are not supported in the terminal formatter summary section")
```


The `format_summary_section` in `TerminalFormatter` logs a warning if comments are passed. Since `format_comments_section` handles comments separately, this warning might be misleading as comments are indeed displayed, just not within the main summary panel. Consider if this log is necessary, and if so, change it to `logger.debug` for internal tracing or rephrase the message to clarify that comments are handled distinctly.

```python
# Suggested change:
# Either remove this warning if the behavior is intended,
# or change to debug level if it's for internal tracing,
# e.g., `logger.debug("Comments are handled separately and not part of the main summary panel")`
```

### üîç Summary

This PR is a significant improvement in the architecture by successfully extracting formatting logic into a dedicated `formatters` package. The introduction of the `ReviewFormatter` protocol, along with `MarkDownFormatter` and `TerminalFormatter` implementations, greatly enhances modularity, testability, and separation of concerns.

The changes are well-implemented and consistent across all affected files. New tests for the formatters are comprehensive, and existing tests have been appropriately updated to reflect the new design. The use of Python's `Protocol` for the formatter interface is an excellent design choice, and centralizing formatting constants is a good practice.

No major issues or bugs were found. This is a high-quality refactor.

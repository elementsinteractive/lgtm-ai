### 🔍 Summary

This Pull Request introduces a new scheduled task to process images from a CSV file, leveraging Celery for background processing. The overall approach and integration with Celery are well-structured. However, the review identifies several critical correctness issues that must be addressed, particularly the highly destructive `Image.objects.all().delete()` operation, which could lead to significant data loss if not intended or properly handled. Additionally, there are a few quality improvements related to code clarity and redundancy. These issues need to be resolved before the PR can be merged.

**Specific Comments:**

- #### 🦉 ✅ Correctness

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```python
(image := entry["image"])
```


The line `(image := entry["image"])` will raise a `KeyError` if the CSV file does not contain an 'image' column. It's safer to use `entry.get("image")` to avoid crashing if the column is optional or might be missing in some CSVs. If 'image' is always expected, then it should be explicitly handled (e.g., raise a custom error) rather than letting a `KeyError` propagate.

```python
            if any(
                (
                    (title := entry.get("title")),
                    (description := entry.get("description")),
                    (image := entry.get("image")),
                )
            ):
```

> **Severity:** HIGH 🔴




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


The `get_content` function can return `None` (e.g., if the URL is invalid or the HTTP request fails). However, `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` expects `list[str]`. Calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(None)` will result in a `TypeError`. You need to add a check for `content is None` before calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.

```python
@shared_task
def load_images() -> None:
    content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
    if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
        Image.objects.all().delete()
        parse_csv(content)
```

```python
Image.objects.all().delete()
```


This line `Image.objects.all().delete()` is highly destructive. It will remove *all* existing `Image` records from the database every time this task runs. This might lead to significant data loss if the intention is not to replace the entire image database with the contents of the CSV.

Please confirm if this behavior is intended. If not, you should consider alternatives such as:

1.  **Upserting**: Update existing records and create new ones. This is typically done by finding a unique identifier in the CSV (e.g., a URL or an external ID) and using `get_or_create` or `update_or_create`.
2.  **Appending**: Only add new records from the CSV without deleting existing ones.
3.  **Soft Delete**: Mark records as inactive instead of truly deleting them.

If the intention is indeed to completely refresh the database with the CSV content, then this needs to be clearly documented, and perhaps a warning logged before execution.



- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡




```python
"Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
        "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
```


The help string for this management command states it's "Deprecated". However, this command is being introduced as part of a new feature (running a scheduled task). This creates a contradiction. Could you please clarify if this command is truly deprecated or if this message is a leftover/misunderstanding?

If it's not truly deprecated, this part should be removed or updated to reflect the command's purpose.



- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡




```python
if any((title, description, image)):
```


This `any` check seems redundant. If the outer `any` (using walrus operators) evaluated to `True` (meaning at least one assignment resulted in a truthy value), then `any((title, description, image))` will also be `True`. You can simplify the logic here.

If the intention is to check if *any* of `title`, `description`, or `image` have a truthy value *after* being extracted from the entry, the walrus operator part might be sufficient, or the conditions could be combined.

For example:

```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        title = entry.get("title")
        description = entry.get("description")
        image = entry.get("image") # using .get() as suggested above
        if any([title, description, image]):
            return True
    return False
```

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵




```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


This change seems like a reformatting of the `DATABASES` setting. While harmless, it's not directly related to the feature. It might be good to separate formatting changes from feature changes to keep PRs focused, unless there's an auto-formatter at play.



- #### 🦉 ✨ Quality

> **Severity:** LOW 🔵




```python
url = url
```


This line is redundant. `url` is already `url` from the function argument. You can remove this line.

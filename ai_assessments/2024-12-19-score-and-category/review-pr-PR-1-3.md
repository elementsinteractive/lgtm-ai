## Summary

> The code introduces a variety of changes involving migrations, service layering, and test improvements. There are some issues and room for quality improvement.

In terms of correctness, one major issue is the default value of `image_id` which may lead to duplicates and unintended conflict in database operations.

The code quality is generally good in terms of following SOLID principles, especially with the introduction of separate classes for data import (`Puller` and `Loader`). However, removing the default empty value for the `image` URLField without providing a rationale could lead to potential issues if existing data is blank, and this needs to be reviewed. Additionally, the `save_with_retry_on_errors` method could create twice the amount of objects in the database, which should be optimized.

Testing has clearly been expanded significantly, and many edge cases are covered, which is excellent. Yet, the tests could be more descriptive on what aspect of functionality they assure.

Required actions include resolving the potential for duplicate `image_id`s, a careful review of the implications of removing `blank=True` for the URLField, and optimizing the `save_with_retry_on_errors` method to avoid potential duplications.


**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment [Correctness] ðŸ”´: src/images/models.py:6: Removing `blank=True` on the `image` URLField will now require that all image fields have a URL. Ensure this change aligns with business requirements, as existing data with null or blank URL could raise errors.

- Comment [Correctness] ðŸ”´: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:6: A default value of 0 for `image_id` with a `unique=True` constraint will likely cause errors when inserting multiple records without providing a specific `image_id`. Consider auto-generating unique IDs or revising this design.

- Comment [Quality] ðŸŸ¡: src/images/services/batches.py:40: In `save_with_retry_on_errors`, you are saving successfully validated items twice when there are errors. Consider restructuring to save items only once and implement retry logic only for failed items.

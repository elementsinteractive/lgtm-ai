## Summary

> The code changes introduce extensive logging improvements across multiple components of the system. The use of the logging module improves debugging capabilities and traceability by adding detailed logs at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR). However, there are some areas that need attention regarding exception handling and code quality.

Summary of required changes:
1. Ensure the log messages provide enough context to be useful for debugging. Adding more details to some of the logs might be beneficial.
2. Verify that all logging is covered by unit tests. Consider increasing test coverage especially for critical paths like error handling.
3. Refactor repeated code patterns to improve maintainability.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment [Quality] ðŸŸ¡: src/lgtm/base/exceptions.py:12: Providing both the formatted message and the stack trace in an error logger might be redundant. Consider structuring the logs to add the necessary context without repeating information.

- Comment [Correctness] ðŸ”´: src/lgtm/git_client/gitlab.py:136: Make sure to clear the cache when relevant state changes (e.g., different auth or state change in a repository) to prevent stale data issues.

- Comment [Quality] ðŸŸ¡: src/lgtm/__main__.py:35: The _set_logging_level function changes global state. Consider the impact of this on other modules or tests and document this behavior clearly.

- Comment [Testing] ðŸŸ¡: tests/test_main.py:19: Consider verifying the logger output with an appropriate logging handler mock to ensure messages are actually being logged at expected levels.

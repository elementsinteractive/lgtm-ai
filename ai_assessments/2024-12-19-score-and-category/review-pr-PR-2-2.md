## Summary

> The overall quality of the code in this pull request is decent, with the main focus being on logging additions and exception handling. It generally improves the observability of the code by providing better insights through logging. It appears to follow SOLID principles and maintains good cleanliness and readability. However, I will highlight a few areas for improvement:

1. **Correctness:** Overall, there is no evident major correctness issue within the code changes. The changes mostly consist of enhancing logs and refactoring exception handling.

2. **Code Quality:** There is a redundancy in separated logic for setting log levels in multiple modules, which can be optimized.

3. **Testing:** A test for setting logging levels is included, but additional testing for ensuring logs are correctly output in various conditions will improve test coverage.

I suggest the following changes:
1. Centralize the logging configuration to avoid repetition.
2. Add more comprehensive logging tests to cover different use cases and ensure the logging works as expected under different scenarios.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

### Comments:

- Comment [Quality] ðŸŸ¢: src/lgtm/__main__.py:74: Instead of setting the logging level separately in each module, consider centralizing the logging configuration logic. This reduces redundancy and maintains consistency across the application. For example:

```python
# In a separate module e.g., utils/logging_setup.py
import logging
from rich.logging import RichHandler

def setup_logging(verbose: int) -> None:
    logging.basicConfig(
        format="%(message)s",
        datefmt="[%X]",
        handlers=[RichHandler(rich_tracebacks=True, show_path=False)]
    )

    logger = logging.getLogger("lgtm")
    if verbose == 0:
        logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
    elif verbose == 1:
        logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    else:
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.info("Logging level set to %s", logging.getLevelName(logger.level))
```
Then, use this setup in your scripts.

- Comment [Testing] ðŸŸ¡: tests/test_main.py:18: While testing the setting of logging levels is good, you should also test if logs are produced as expected during various execution scenarios. Consider mocking a logger and asserting log calls in different code paths.

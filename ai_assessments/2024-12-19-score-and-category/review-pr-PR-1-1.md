## Summary

> The codebase overall shows significant changes related to batch processing and data importation improvements. Many aspects of the code have been modified, including models, serializers, services, and tasks. The PR also seems to focus on batch processing optimization by introducing the `BatchStorageProcedure` class. There is a fair amount of refactor, such as moving functions from services to their dedicated files, which is a good practice for separation of concern. The testing coverage is reasonably good, ensuring edge cases and error handling are well tested. However, there are a few issues that need attention:

1. **Correctness**: There are no serious logical errors in the implementation, which is promising. However, there is a potential issue with the `image_id` uniqueness in the `Image` model when importing new data - if not carefully managed, it might lead to collisions.

2. **Code Quality**: The use of magic numbers, e.g., batch size, should be minimized. It would be better if constants are well defined and documented.
   
3. **Testing**: While tests are comprehensive, ensuring that all new parts of the code are covered is crucial. Add unit tests for the `BatchStorageProcedure` to ensure the batch processing logic is robust. Moreover, the test for the correctness of serialization needs to be precise, particularly when dealing with batch operations.

Suggestions for improvement include:
- Address the potential `image_id` collision problem.
- Review the code for magic numbers and replace them with defined constants.
- Extend testing for batch processing specifically - consider edge cases like empty batches or already existing entries in the database.


**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

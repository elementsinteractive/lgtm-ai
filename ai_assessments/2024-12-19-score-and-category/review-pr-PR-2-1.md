## Summary

> Overall, the code quality is quite good. The main changes focus on the integration of logging throughout the codebase. Logging has been added to multiple modules, enhancing the traceability and debuggability of the operations, which is a good practice. This improves the maintainability of the code. 

However, there are some areas that require attention for improvement:
1. Ensure the logging configuration is done once and consistently across the codebase.
2. Consider the security and performance implications of extensive logging, especially in production.
3. More comprehensive test coverage for logging functionality should be provided especially for new logging methods.

The renaming of paths and refactoring appears to be well done, but attention to testing improvements across the whole module is needed.

Overall, it's a positive enhancement with minor improvements required.

**Score:** Needs Some Work ðŸ”§

游불 **lgtm Review**

**Summary:**

The refactored code introduces new formatters for rendering review and comment data in a more structured and organized manner using protocols, which provides flexibility and scalability for different output formats. The PR makes good use of the Protocol class to define formatter behaviors, which aligns with SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle. However, there are some suggestions and necessary corrections to improve code quality and correctness. Tests for new functionalities are present, which is commendable.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/lgtm/ai/schemas.py:14` Consider removing unused imports such as 'computed_field', which are no longer used after the refactor. This will enhance code readability and cleanliness.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/lgtm/__main__.py:69` The logging and normal machinery for printing the review to the console should handle the possibility of comments being None, although it might not be likely in practical use. Implement check for 'None' type scenarios to maintain robustness.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댮 `tests/git_client/test_gitlab.py:20` Ensure that MockFormatter in the test does not swallow possible exceptions by returning a fixed string. If a bug was introduced in the formatter methods, ensure that they fail the tests to indicate incorrect behavior.

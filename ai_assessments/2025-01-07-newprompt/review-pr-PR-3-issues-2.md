**Summary:**

The changes introduced in this PR include modifications to the Django settings for adding a Celery beat schedule, a new management command for loading images, a Celery task for parsing images from a CSV file, and corresponding tests. The overall organization of the code is good, but there are a few issues that need addressing. Here's a summary of the necessary changes:

1. **Celery Task and Management Command**:
   - The code adequately introduces a new Celery task (`load_images`) and corresponding management command. However, the management command's help text is misleading as it indicates deprecation. Consider updating the help text if the command is still relevant.

2. **CSV and URL Validation**:
   - The function `get_content` uses `httpx.get` to access a URL, which is fine for synchronous operations, but consider adding timeout handling to avoid potential blocking issues.

3. **Testing**:
   - There is a test ensuring the management command `load_images` executes as expected. However, consider adding more detailed tests for the different parts of the task, including edge cases like invalid CSV files or unreachable URLs.

4. **Code Quality**:
   - The code follows good practices but could benefit from additional comments for clarity on complex parts, especially within loops and conditionals.


**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:9` The help text states that the command is deprecated. If this command is intended for current use, consider updating the help text to prevent confusion.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:36` Consider adding a `timeout` parameter to `httpx.get` to handle potential blocking issues and improve fault-tolerance of this function.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:47` You might want to log information about the success or failure of the import operation for better tracking and debugging.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댮 `tests/images/test_commands.py:4` The current test checks the command execution but does not verify if the task behaves correctly with different CSV contents. Consider expanding tests to cover scenarios with invalid CSV data and unreachable SRC_FILE URLs.

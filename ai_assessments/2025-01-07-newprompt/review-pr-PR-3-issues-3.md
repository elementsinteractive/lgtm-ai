游불 **lgtm Review**

**Summary:**

The code in this PR seems mostly functional and adheres to standard Django and Celery practices. However, there are some areas that could use improvement, particularly with respect to error handling and test coverage. In particular, there are potential issues with assuming the presence and validity of environment variables without handling potential `None` or invalid values. Additionally, there's a lack of comprehensive tests, especially for the Celery task and scenarios where key operations could fail. Improving error handling and enrichening tests would strengthen this codebase overall.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댯 `src/config/settings.py:63` The change simplifies the dictionary definition, which is fine. However, consider verifying if the database URL is being explicitly checked and potentially adding error handling around it.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:13` The command is marked as deprecated, but perhaps more context is needed for future maintenance. Consider adding comments or documentation about when exactly this command should be removed or what replaces it.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:28` The return type should be "Optional[list[str]]" to accurately reflect the case where it returns None.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:39` Environment variables can be `None`, ideally you'd want to handle the case when `os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")` is None before passing it to `get_content`.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:42` Consider logging a message or raising an exception in case content is None, to aid debugging.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:10` This test only checks that the command finishes execution successfully. Consider adding tests for cases where the command fails, to ensure robust error handling.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댯 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8` You could enhance test isolation by mocking the `call_command` function itself, ensuring no side effects.

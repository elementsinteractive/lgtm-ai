**Summary:**

The changes in this PR are mostly configuration updates, specifically changing commit identifiers, and modifying installation hooks and stages for pre-commit configurations. These updates are likely in response to a need for more specific or correct staging during git operations; however, there is not much to review in terms of functionality or testing as these are configuration adjustments. The updates imply a shift to more specific pre-push and pre-commit hooks from the generic push and commit hooks, which can have implications on how and when checks are performed in your git process. Although these are low-risk changes, it's vital to ensure the configurations align with your team's workflow. Given the limited and clear scope of the changes, it looks good overall.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댯 `.cruft.json:3` Updated commit hash. Ensure this corresponds to the correct and intended version of the package template.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3` The change from 'push' to 'pre-push' is correct if the intention is to run hooks just before the push operation rather than any push-related operations. Verify if this aligns with expected development practices.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:9` Similarly, changing from 'commit' to 'pre-commit' ensures hooks are triggered before the commit is made, not during it. This flow adjustment should be consistent with your team's CI/CD requirements.

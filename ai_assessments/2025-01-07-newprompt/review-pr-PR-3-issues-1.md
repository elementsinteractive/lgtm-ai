**Summary:**

The code provided introduces new functionality related to the loading of images as a scheduled task with Celery, adds management commands, and tests for command execution. Some improvements and corrections are needed:

1. **Correctness**:
   - Ensure that the `os.environ.get("SRC_FILE")` key is defined or handle cases where it might be `None` to prevent errors in `get_content`.
   - Consider using exception handling around the `httpx.get` request to manage network-related errors.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - The new code for checking CSV content readability should use meaningful variable names and a cleaner structure if possible. Improve readability in functions like `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.
   - The task `load_images` deletes all Image objects before parsing new ones, which might lead to data loss if the CSV content is invalid or partially valid. You should consider implementing a safer approach.

3. **Testing**:
   - There should be more comprehensive tests for the `load_images` task covering different scenarios, such as valid input, invalid input, and network failures.

The changes are mostly correct but require some adjustments for better robustness and coverage.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:44` Consider adding exception handling around the `httpx.get` method to avoid having unhandled network errors which might cause task failure.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:46` Check and handle the case where `content` could be `None`. Currently, the code might fail ungracefully in `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:9` `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function should be refactored for better readability and maintainability. Consider using list comprehension for the loop.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:45` Deleting all images before verifying CSV content might result in unwanted data loss. Consider verifying CSV content validity entirely before deletion.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:1` Include tests for varying CSV inputs and task execution results to ensure robustness and reliability for edge cases.

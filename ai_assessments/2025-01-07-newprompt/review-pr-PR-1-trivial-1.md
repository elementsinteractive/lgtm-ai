**Summary:**

The changes in this PR involve updating a commit in the .cruft.json file and modifying hook types and stages in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file. The modification of hooks from 'push' to 'pre-push' and 'commit' to 'pre-commit' aligns with standard naming conventions and likely reflects a change in desired hook execution logic. Both files are correctly formatted YAML/JSON and don't contain errors. There is no functional code or business logic change that requires additional scrutiny or testing beyond verifying the structural integrity of these files.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3` Changing the hook from 'push' to 'pre-push' allows pre-push hooks to run, which is more conventional and likely aligns better with intended functionality. Make sure to update any related documentation if necessary to reflect this change.

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸ”µ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:7` Ensure any documentation or dependencies relying on 'commit' hooks are updated to reflect the change to 'pre-commit'. This alteration may impact how and when certain scripts are executed.

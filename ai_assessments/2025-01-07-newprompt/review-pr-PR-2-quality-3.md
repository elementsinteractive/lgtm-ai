**Summary:**

The refactoring and enhancement in this pull request bring notable improvements to the formatter architecture of the review system, abstracting different formatting strategies into separate classes. The introduction of Markdown and Terminal formatters increases flexibility and maintainability. However, there are some areas needing attention, especially regarding code quality and testing.

The major issues include:
- Repeated initialization of `MarkDownFormatter` can be avoided by passing it into the function parameters or using dependency injection.
- The integration of a formatter with `GitlabClient` requires more test coverage to ensure that all new branches introduced by the formatter are properly tested.

Required changes:
1. Enhance the test coverage to include different cases for formatter utilization.
2. Clean repetitive code by utilizing dependency injection or function parameters to reduce multiple initializations of the same object.

Overall, the code changes provide an admirable restructuring with potential improvements to make the code more efficient and robust.

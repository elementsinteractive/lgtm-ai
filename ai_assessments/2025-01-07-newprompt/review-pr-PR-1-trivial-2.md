**Summary:**

The changes in this pull request modify the commit reference in the `.cruft.json` file and update the hooks and stages in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. 

1. Changing the commit reference in `.cruft.json`: This update seems to be aligned with a new commit from the `pypackage-skeleton.git` template. No issues here if this is intentional and the commit `381fcbbe5e4048233208117a779a5ac8e26a6dba` is indeed a required update.

2. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` updates: Modifying hook types and stages might affect when the hooks are executed. Ensure that this aligns with the team's workflow, particularly changing stage names from "push" to "pre-push" and "commit" to "pre-commit" as it changes the context of hook execution.

No major issues detected with correctness or syntax as long as these changes are intentional and tested in the workflow.

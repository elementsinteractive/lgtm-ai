# Review for PR: PR-1

> Sample 2

## Summary

> The code changes incorporate significant enhancements across multiple files, especially adding a new batch processing service, enhancing the image model, and improving serialization and database handling. Here are some points to address:
- Ensure that all migrations are properly tested as significant changes were made to the database schema.
- When using serializers, consider whether additional validation or error handling is needed, particularly in bulk operations.
- The current setting of `BULK_CREATE_LIST_SERIALIZER_BATCH_SIZE` defaults to 100. It would be beneficial to provide feedback if this could potentially overwhelm the database or application during peak loads.
- Make sure to update any corresponding documentation to reflect the new features introduced, like the `importer` functions and their expected use cases.
- The test cases for the various services appear strong; however, maintaining a parallel testing mechanism is advisable to manage integration points effectively, especially with external services.

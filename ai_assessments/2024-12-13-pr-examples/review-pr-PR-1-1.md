# Review for PR: PR-1

> Sample 1

## Summary

> The code changes appear to be well-structured and follow best practices. However, make sure to test the new features thoroughly, especially error handling in batch creation. Consider adding type hints where missing for improved clarity. Also, double-check changes in migrations since these directly affect your database. Please review those carefully and ensure tests cover these scenarios. Overall, the code looks solid, just a few areas for potential improvement in testing and type hinting.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/config/settings.py:4: Add configuration for BULK_CREATE_LIST_SERIALIZER_BATCH_SIZE to settings. Ensure this setting is utilized correctly throughout the project for bulk operations.

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:25: When defining indexes, ensure that the fields specified for indexing are necessary. Review whether the `image_id` needs an index, considering it defaults to unique.

- Comment: src/images/migrations/0001_initial.py:25: Be careful when using unique indexes. If there are use cases where records might be similar, it could lead to integrity errors during inserts. Confirm this design choice.

- Comment: src/images/models.py:6: Remove 'blank=True' from image field if there are validations that expect an image at all times. Assess the business use case thoroughly.

- Comment: src/images/serializers.py:5: Consider adding type hints wherever they are missing, particularly for the methods in the `BulkCreateListSerializer`. This aids maintainability and readability.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:39: Review the saving logic in `save_with_retry_on_errors` method for potential improvements. Ensure any exceptions are logged for debugging purposes.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:8: Check the flow and error-handling when `BatchStorageProcedure.start` is called. Any failure on resource retrieval could halt the process without logging.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:10: Be cautious about raising exceptions in the `importer` function. It might create unhandled situations if the imported resource is malformed. Consider how this might affect user experience.

- Comment: tests/images/test_tasks.py:22: Ensure that you have sufficient test coverage for the batch operations, especially around edge cases such as empty inputs or misaligned data types.

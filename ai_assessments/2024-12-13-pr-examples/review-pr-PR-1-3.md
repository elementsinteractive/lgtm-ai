# Review for PR: PR-1

> Sample 3

## Summary

> The code changes look solid overall. However, ensure that migration files are managed correctly to avoid issues in production. Also, consider whether adjustments related to the constraints on "image_id" should be tested with some related unit tests. Make sure to write tests for newly added functionalities in both services and serializers as a good practice.

### Comments:

- Comment: src/images/models.py:5: src/images/models.py:5 - The image field does not have a `blank=True` argument which might prevent the field from being empty. Is this intended?

- Comment: src/images/serializers.py:35: src/images/serializers.py:35 - Consider adding validation logic to enforce the image size limit if necessary (e.g., `max_length` for URLs) since the field can accept arbitrary input.

- Comment: src/images/services/batches.py:40: src/images/services/batches.py:40 - The existing error handling appears to be basic. It might be beneficial to add logging or more detailed error outputs to assist in debugging.

- Comment: src/images/services/importers.py:16: src/images/services/importers.py:16 - Ensure that the `importer` function gracefully handles scenarios where the 'ImageSerializer' raises validation errors after data is processed.

- Comment: tests/images/test_serializers.py:2: tests/images/test_serializers.py:2 - Ensure that tests adequately cover edge cases, such as data with invalid URLs or incomplete data structures. These cases are critical given the bulk creation process being introduced.

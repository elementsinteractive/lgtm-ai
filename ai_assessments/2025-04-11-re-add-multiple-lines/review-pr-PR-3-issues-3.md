游불 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks 游뱁

**Summary:**

The PR introduces several changes to the image management and task scheduling functionality. Overall, the structural approach is solid, though several areas need attention in terms of code quality, correctness, and testing:

1. **Code Quality**: 
   - The database configuration in `settings.py` is duplicated, creating unnecessary verbosity.
   - There is an unnecessary self-assignment in the `get_content` function that should be cleaned up.
   - The help message for the `load_images` command suggests it's deprecated; this should be clarified or the command should be removed.

2. **Correctness**: 
   - In the `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` function, if `content` is `None`, it will raise an exception. This should be handled gracefully.

3. **Testing**:
   - The test for the `load_images` command is quite basic and additional test cases should be added to cover various scenarios including failure cases.

Overall, the PR presents good structure and functionality but requires some adjustments in the aforementioned areas before it can be merged.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/config/settings.py:95`




```python
DATABASES = {"default": env.dj_db_url("DATABASE_URL", conn_max_age=env.int("DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE", default=60))}
```


This line duplicates the database settings which are defined earlier in the file, leading to redundant code. Consider removing this duplication to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/tasks.py:32`




```python
url = url
```


The variable 'url' is being reassigned to itself, which is unnecessary. Removing this line will clean up the function.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


Ensure to handle the case when `content` is `None` in `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. This will prevent an exception due to iterating over a NoneType.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:8`




```python
help = (
    "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
    "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
)
```


The help message indicates this command is deprecated. Consider removing this command or ensuring the context for its usage is clearly explained.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游댯 `tests/images/test_commands.py:8`




```python
def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
```


While the test confirms the command execution and output, it would be beneficial to test more scenarios, such as failure cases and handling issues during the loading process.

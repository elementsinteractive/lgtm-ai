**Summary:**

The PR involves simple updates to configuration files: `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. In the `.cruft.json`, the commit hash version was updated, which is straightforward and non-problematic. In the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, there are changes to the default stages and install hook types, effectively improving clarity by specifying `pre-push` instead of just `push`. These changes also incorporate a `pre-commit` hook to ensure consistency across different stages.

The modifications contribute positively to maintaining configuration consistency and enhancing code quality assurance mechanisms. There are no functional risks associated with these changes. Everything is correctly implemented and follows good practices.

Overall, the changes are well-executed and the PR is ready to be merged.

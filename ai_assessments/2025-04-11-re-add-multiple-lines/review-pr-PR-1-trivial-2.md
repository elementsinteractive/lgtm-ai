🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

The PR introduces minor updates to configuration files: specifically, it updates a commit hash in the `.cruft.json` file and modifies hook names and stages in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. These changes are simple and primarily focus on maintaining current configurations and ensuring proper workflow integrations. The overall quality is good, but make sure that the new configuration changes work seamlessly in the CI/CD pipeline to avoid any unexpected issues. Given the nature of the modifications, and with the addressed suggestion for consistent YAML indentation, this PR is nearly ready to merge.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:33`




```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```


The indentation for the "pre-commit" stage seems inconsistent compared to the other list items under `stages`. Consistent indentation helps in maintaining the readability of YAML files.

You can correct it by ensuring all items under `stages` align properly. For example:
```yaml
stages:
  - "commit"
  - "pre-commit"
```

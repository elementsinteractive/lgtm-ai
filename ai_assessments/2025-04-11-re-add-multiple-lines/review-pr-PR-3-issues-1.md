**Summary:**

The PR introduces several new features:

1. A new Celery beat schedule is configured in the settings to automate tasks.
2. A new Django management command `load_images` is added for loading images, though it is marked as deprecated, leading to potential confusion.
3. A new Celery task `load_images` is added, and a test for the management command is included.

Overall, the PR is well-structured and generally adheres to Django and Celery best practices. However, there are some areas for improvement:
- Environment variables in `settings.py` should be checked or have default values to avoid deployment issues.
- The network call in the Celery task should have exception handling to avoid crashes.

There are a couple of medium- and high-severity issues to address before merging.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/config/settings.py:171`




```python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11")
hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1")
```


Ensure that the environment variables exist or provide safe defaults to avoid runtime errors during deployment, especially for `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` and `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR`.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:9`




```python
help = (
    "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
    "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
)
```


The docstring indicates that the command is deprecated. If deprecated, consider removing this management command to avoid confusion or update the docstring if it should still be used.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:39`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


Consider handling potential exceptions for the network call to prevent the task from crashing if the HTTP request fails. Use a try-except block around the `httpx.get` call. For example:
```python
try:
    response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text.splitlines(True)
except httpx.RequestError as exc:
    # Handle request exception
    return None
```

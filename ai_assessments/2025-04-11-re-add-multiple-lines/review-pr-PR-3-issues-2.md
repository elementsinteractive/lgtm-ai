**Summary:**

The pull request introduces new functionality to integrate Celery beat schedules for running tasks at configured times and adds a Django management command for loading images from a CSV file. The core implementation is solid, but there are several improvements needed for robustness and compliance with Django standards. Specifically, attention is needed to handle edge cases, particularly regarding error handling and exceptions. The testing approach also lacks breadth and needs to validate more scenarios.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:14`




```python
def handle(self, *args, **options):
    load_images()
    return "Done"
```


The `handle` method should not return a value as part of Django management command specs. Consider printing a message or using logging for output purposes.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:47`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```


Handle cases where `content` could be `None` to avoid exceptions when calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. Log a warning or error if content is `None`.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:39`




```python
response: Response = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.text.splitlines(True)
```


Introduce exception handling around the HTTP request to address cases where the request might fail or return unexpected status codes. Add logging for monitoring failures.

- 游불 **[Testing]** 游리 `tests/images/test_commands.py:17`




```python
class TestLoadImagesCMD:
    def test_load_images_command_executes_when_called(self, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
        monkeypatch.setattr(
            "images.management.commands.load_images.load_images",
            lambda *args, **kwargs: None,
        )
        out = StringIO()

        call_command("load_images", stdout=out)

        assert str(out.getvalue()).strip() == "Done"
```


Expand the current test to verify that the `load_images` command triggers the expected behavior of actually loading images, maybe by checking database changes or mocking the affected components.

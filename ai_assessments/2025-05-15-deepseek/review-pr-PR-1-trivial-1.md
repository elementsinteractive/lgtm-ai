🦉 **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** LGTM 👍

**Summary:**

The PR updates the `.cruft.json` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files with minor changes. The changes are straightforward and do not introduce any functional or security issues. There are a couple of minor quality improvements that could be made, such as ensuring consistency in the `default_stages` and `stages` sections of the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Overall, the PR is in good shape and ready to be merged after addressing these minor suggestions.

**Specific Comments:**

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:3`




```yaml
  - "pre-push"
```


The change from `- "push"` to `- "pre-push"` is correct, but it would be clearer to also update the `default_stages` section to explicitly include `pre-push` for consistency. For example:
```yaml
default_stages:
  - "pre-commit"
  - "pre-push"
```

- 🦉 **[Quality]** 🔵 `.pre-commit-config.yaml:33`




```yaml
          - "pre-commit"
```


The change from `- "commit"` to `- "pre-commit"` is correct, but the `stages` section for the `format-code` hook should also be updated to reflect this change for consistency. For example:
```yaml
stages:
  - "pre-commit"
```

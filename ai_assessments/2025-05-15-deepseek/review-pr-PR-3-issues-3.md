**Summary:**

The PR introduces a scheduled task to process CSV files and load images. The implementation is functional but has several issues that need addressing, particularly around error handling, data validation, and configuration robustness. The changes are mostly sound, but refinements are required to ensure correctness, security, and maintainability.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游댮 `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


The function `load_images` assumes that `content` is not `None` when calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. If `get_content` returns `None`, this will raise a `TypeError`. Add a check for `None` before processing the content. For example:
```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if content is None:
    return
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    ...
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:16`




```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        if any(
            (
                (title := entry.get("title")),
                (description := entry.get("description")),
                (image := entry["image"]),
            )
        ):
            if any((title, description, image)):
                return True
    return False
```


The function `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` checks for the existence of fields but does not validate their content. For example, it does not ensure that `image` is a valid URL or that `title` and `description` are non-empty strings. This could lead to invalid data being processed. Consider adding validation for these fields.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:31`




```python
def get_content(url: str | None) -> list[str] | None:
    url = url
    validate = URLValidator()
    try:
        validate(url)
    except ValidationError:
        return None
```


The function `get_content` does not handle cases where `url` is `None` or an empty string, which could lead to a `TypeError` or `ValidationError` being raised unnecessarily. Add a check for `None` or empty strings at the start of the function. For example:
```python
if not url:
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Security]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:48`




```python
Image.objects.all().delete()
parse_csv(content)
```


The function `load_images` deletes all `Image` objects before parsing the CSV. This could lead to data loss if the CSV parsing fails. Consider wrapping this operation in a transaction or adding error handling to ensure data integrity. For example:
```python
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    Image.objects.all().delete()
    parse_csv(content)
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/config/settings.py:171`




```python
minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
```


The `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` configuration uses environment variables `TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE` and `CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR` without providing defaults in the `env` calls. This could lead to runtime errors if these variables are not set. Consider providing sensible defaults.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:8`




```python
"Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
```


The `help` text mentions that the command is deprecated, but the command is still being implemented. If the command is truly deprecated, it should be removed. Otherwise, update the `help` text to reflect its current purpose.

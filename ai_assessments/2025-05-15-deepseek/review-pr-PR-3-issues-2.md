**Summary:**

The PR introduces a scheduled task to process CSV files for loading images. The overall quality is good, with minor issues related to correctness and quality that need addressing. The changes are well-structured, but some improvements can be made to ensure robustness and maintainability. The PR is almost ready to be merged, with only minor tweaks required.

**Specific Comments:**

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:16`




```python
def csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content: list[str]) -> bool:
    reader = csv.DictReader(content)
    for entry in reader:
        if any(
            (
                (title := entry.get("title")),
                (description := entry.get("description")),
                (image := entry["image"]),
            )
        ):
            if any((title, description, image)):
                return True
    return False
```


The function `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record` checks for the existence of fields but does not validate their content. For example, it does not ensure that `image` is a valid URL or that `title` and `description` are non-empty strings. This could lead to invalid data being processed. Consider adding validation for these fields.

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:31`




```python
def get_content(url: str | None) -> list[str] | None:
    url = url
    validate = URLValidator()
    try:
        validate(url)
    except ValidationError:
        return None
```


The function `get_content` does not handle cases where `url` is `None` or an empty string. This could lead to a `ValidationError` or unexpected behavior. Add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` if `url` is falsy. For example:
```python
if not url:
    return None
```

- 游불 **[Correctness]** 游리 `src/images/tasks.py:46`




```python
content = get_content(os.environ.get("SRC_FILE"))
if csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
```


The function `load_images` does not handle the case where `content` is `None` (e.g., if `get_content` fails). This could lead to a `TypeError` when calling `csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record`. Add a check to handle this case gracefully. For example:
```python
if content and csv_contains_at_least_one_valid_record(content):
    ...
```

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/config/settings.py:167`




```python
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    "load_images": {
        "task": "images.tasks.load_images",
        "schedule": crontab(
            minute=env("TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_MINUTE", "11"),
            hour=env("CELERY_TRIGGER_REBUILD_AT_HOUR", "1"),
        ),
    }
}
```


The `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` configuration uses environment variables for the schedule, but there is no validation or default handling for these variables. If they are not set, the task might not run as expected. Consider adding validation or defaults in the settings.

- 游불 **[Quality]** 游댯 `src/images/management/commands/load_images.py:7`




```python
help = (
    "Loads images. Intended to be run every time the app starts. "
    "Deprecated: 3 dummy records are generated running migrations already. "
)
```


The `help` text mentions that the command is deprecated, but the command is still being added and used. If it is truly deprecated, consider removing it. Otherwise, update the help text to reflect its current purpose.

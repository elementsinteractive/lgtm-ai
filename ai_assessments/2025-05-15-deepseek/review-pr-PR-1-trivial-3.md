ðŸ¦‰ **lgtm Review**

> **Score:** Nitpicks ðŸ¤“

**Summary:**

The PR updates the `.cruft.json` commit hash and modifies the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to change the hook types from `push` to `pre-push` and `commit` to `pre-commit`. These changes are straightforward and do not introduce any functional or security issues. The PR description is incomplete and lacks clarity about the purpose of the changes, which is the primary issue to address.

**Specific Comments:**

- ðŸ¦‰ **[Quality]** ðŸŸ¡ `.pre-commit-config.yaml:1`

The PR description is incomplete and does not explain the purpose or context of the changes. Please update it to provide clarity.

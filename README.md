## Installation

To install this package, you need a [personal access token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens). 


```sh
# through the project repository
pip install lgtm --index-url https://__token__:<your_personal_token>@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT-ID>/packages/pypi/simple

# through a group repository
pip install lgtm --index-url https://__token__:<your_personal_token>@gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/<GROUP-ID>/-/packages/pypi/simple
```

You can also configure `pip` globally in your `.pypirc` file:

```
[gitlab]
repository = https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT-ID>/packages/pypi
username = __token__
password = <your personal access token>
```

For a comprehensive guide of how to set this up, and to make it work with `poetry` and/or `docker`, take a look at [this guide](https://www.notion.so/msdevelopment/How-to-use-Gitlab-s-registry-for-PyPi-d9f8fdbc00144dc786de550153c56cd9?pvs=4).


## Running the project
This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) recipes to do all the basic operations (testing the package, formatting the code, etc.).

Installation: 

```sh
brew install just
# or
snap install --edge --classic just
```

It requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

These are the available commands for the justfile:

```
Available recipes:
    help                        # Shows list of recipes.
    venv                        # Generate the virtual environment.
    clean                       # Cleans all artifacts generated while running this project, including the virtualenv.
    test *test-args=''          # Runs the tests with the specified arguments (any path or pytest argument).
    t *test-args=''             # alias for `test`
    test-all                    # Runs all tests including coverage report.
    format                      # Format all code in the project.
    lint                        # Lint all code in the project.
    docs                        # Serve the documentation in a local server.
    pre-commit *precommit-args  # Runs pre-commit with the given arguments (defaults to install).
    spellcheck *codespell-args  # Spellchecks your markdown files.
    lint-commit                 # Lints commit messages according to conventional commit rules.
```

To run the tests of this package, simply run:

```sh
# All tests
just t

# A single test
just t tests/test_dummy.py

# Pass arguments to pytest like this
just t -k test_dummy -vv
```

## Managing requirements

`poetry` is the tool we use for managing requirements in this project. The generated virtual environment is kept within the directory of the project (in a directory named `.venv`), thanks to the option `POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=1`. Refer to the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/) to see the list of available commands.

As a short summary:

- Add a dependency:

        poetry add foo-bar

- Remove a dependency:

        poetry remove foo-bar

- Update a dependency (within constraints set in `pyproject.toml`):

        poetry update foo-bar

- Update the lockfile with the contents of `pyproject.toml` (for instance, when getting a conflict after a rebase):

        poetry lock --no-update

- Check if `pyproject.toml` is in sync with `poetry.lock`:

        poetry lock --check


## Contributing
In this project we enforce [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines for commit messages. The usage of [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is recommended, but not required. Story numbers (JIRA, etc.) must go in the scope section of the commit message. Example message:

```
feat(JIRA-XXX): add new feature x
```

Merge requests must be approved before they can be merged to the `main` branch, and all the steps in the `ci` pipeline must pass.

This project includes an optional pre-commit configuration. Note that all necessary checks are always executed in the ci pipeline, but
configuring pre-commit to execute some of them can be beneficial to reduce late errors. To do so, simply execute the following just recipe:

```
just pre-commit
```
